You are a professional English-Russian dictionary editor.
Below are 50 English words with their context from reference datasets (IPA, existing definitions, Russian translations, semantic relations).

For EACH word produce an improved dictionary entry in JSON format.
Separate consecutive JSON objects with a line containing only "---".
Output NOTHING except the JSON objects and the "---" separators — no markdown, no explanations.

Each JSON must match this exact schema:
{
  "word": "<word>",
  "source_slug": "llm",
  "senses": [
    {
      "pos": "<NOUN|VERB|ADJECTIVE|ADVERB|PRONOUN|PREPOSITION|CONJUNCTION|INTERJECTION|PHRASE|IDIOM|OTHER>",
      "definition": "<clear English definition for B1+ learners>",
      "cefr_level": "<A1|A2|B1|B2|C1|C2>",
      "notes": "<learning tip in Russian: collocations, register, common mistakes>",
      "translations": ["<Russian 1>", "<Russian 2>"],
      "examples": [
        {"sentence": "<English example>", "translation": "<Russian translation>"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Rewrite definitions to be clearer and more useful for learners
- Provide 2-4 Russian translations per sense
- Write notes in Russian
- Generate 1-3 natural example sentences with Russian translations
- Preserve the word order — output exactly 50 JSON objects in the same order
