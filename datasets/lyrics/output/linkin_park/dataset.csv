One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away,
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be"

There are things that we can have but can't keep

It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need, oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there

And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me

'Cause I can't escape the gravity

I'm holding on

Holding on
To so much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on

You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe

To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take

There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies

So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've

Done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

I'm picking me apart again
You all assume I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside, I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

When this began
) I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(
I was confused
) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(
Inside of me
) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(
Nothing to lose
) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(
I was confused
) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me

Nothing to lose
) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone

I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone

All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together

Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake
For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

Used to be generous, but you shoulda known

Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss

Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hell day
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong (

Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear

Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me, and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest

Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in

Say your prayers and stomp it out

Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?

The hardest part of endin' is startin' again (

Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor
Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughin' their way to the bank and cashin' the check
Askin' you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world watchin' at the end of the day
In the livin' room laughin', like, ""What did he say?""

Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

In my livin' room watching, but I am not laughin'
'Cause when it gets tense, I know what might happen
The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions
Ten years old there, somethin' to see
Another kid my age drugged under a Jeep
Taken and bound, and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me
Do you see the soldiers that are out today?
They brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic, at times like this, you'd pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear, I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
On the back, he hand-wrote a quote inside
""When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die""

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stutterin' and mumblin' for nightly news to replay
The rest of the world watchin', at the end of the day
Both scared and angry, like, ""What did he say?""

Amen, amen
Amen, amen
Amen

With hands held high into a sky so blue (
Amen

As the ocean opens up to swallow you (

Hold my breath until I'm blue

Poison on his lips, and his words mean nothin'
Cold like a mountaintop, father never loved him
Mama said he's bad enough times that it sunk in
Everybody out, that devil is comin'
Promise you the world, but he's always bluffin'
Before you even know it's a trap, you're stuck in
He's gone like a ghost, already off runnin'

Now sometimes these thoughts in my head speak so loud
Every little thing that I think about
Just builds on top of the pain and doubt
Even though I wanna just let it out
I try to act like I don't mind it, try to keep my mouth so quiet
But sittin' there in my silence just seems to amplify it
When I thought that keepin' this inside would make it better
I never thought that I would end up ruining it forever
But every time I think I got everything put back together
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

Falling from grace, I watch it all come apart
Knowing I could've changed it all from the start
Fighting myself, I always lose
Fighting myself, I always lose

I didn't want you to think I'm worn out so easily
I wish I'd held it in so you never knew what built up inside of me
Now I don't know how it overflowed, spilled out unwillingly
But now everything that I learned to hate came out for you to see
I don't want you to promise you can change everything and make it better
'Cause you can bet I'm gonna end up ruining it forever
And every time you think you got everything put back together
I end up making more regrets, making more regrets

I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed

To save face, how low can you go?

Get down and obey every word
Steady gettin' mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don't be absurd
Don't fight the power, nobody gets hurt

And no one make a move 'less my people say so
Got everything outta control, now everybody go

I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person tellin' you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Y'all oughta stop talkin', start tryin' to catch up, motherfucker

Big said, ""It increase the complication""
Kane said, ""Don't step, I ain't the one""
Chuck said, ""That Uzi weigh a motherfuckin' ton""
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rockin' every stage in every place that it brought me
I'm awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'ma state it for the record
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak, opposite of slack
Synonym of heat, synonym of crack
Closest to a peak, far from a punk

Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think havin' the upper hand means you gotta keep puttin' me down
But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won
And then it's all gone

So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall, and I'm countin' down the time
'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waitin' until the upper hand is mine

One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won

And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
And then it's all gone
Now it's all gone

I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall

One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, watch it drop
Makin' your heart stop
Just before you hit the floor
One minute, you're on top
The next you're not, missed your shot
Makin' your heart stop
You think you won

And take and take and never say

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, blackout, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breakin'
You run but then back, you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're makin'
You can't get enough, you take
And take, and take, and take, and take
Fuck it, are you listening?

Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paper white
And floating up, you pass us in the night
A future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down, oh"

Can y'all explain, what kind of land is this
When a man has plans of bein' rich but the bosses' plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split, nonsense
It's insane, even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets, and realty
At anybody's expense, no shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free, they claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as the dough or the deal peak
Say it's time for things to change
Rearrange like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock 'til pop and radio
And record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be?
You feel me, we'll see
That green could be to blame or greedy for the fame
TV or a name, the Media, the game
To me you're all the same, you're guilty

You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
You're guilty all the same, too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger, but there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame, guilty all the same

Guilty all the same

I've been diggin' into crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double-helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg-braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalness on all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I firebomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved onto a promise
I stomp sh— with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil, pistol

So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got, it's
A pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it like that

It ain't over 'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you can try to fill my shoes

Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing, ""Bring me to kingdom come""

It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give me what you need like Poppa, who shot you?

You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants

You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank takedown
And no mistakes now, I'm comin' to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a brainwash
Get the picture? It's like that

We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more

We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know

Today, I looked for a sign with flames in my hands
A line in the sand between yours and mine
And it came like fire from below
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall, but little did you know

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, ""Give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine!""

I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
You'd sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood
We were countin' on a leader, we were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper, we were waitin' on a wire
So we never saw it comin' when you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation, and you can try to ignore
But when the time comes callin', yeah, you are gonna get yours

Another day, your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours and face your crime
You'll tell them, ""Give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine!""

And so today, your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you've, pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine, give me back what's mine

Give me, give me back what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine
Give me, give me back what's mine, what's mine, what's mine
Give me back what's mine!

Today, we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns, we laughed at it all
And when they, they told us to go
We paid them no mind like every other time, but little did we know"

Maybe sympathy is all you're really hungry for

And you say that they beat you down

To slay and leave 'em layin' on the pavement, bang, fade to black

In the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose
And there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose
In the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears
While the future slips away and your hope turns into fear
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, you get it, the show is done
They're talkin' for just talkin', but meaning, they got none
None of 'em come proper, they talk like a shotgun
But how many got bred with integrity? Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me
Ain't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see

And then in the middle, came Motion Man
And at the end of it all, it was KutMasta Kurt with a remix
(A remix, a remix, a remix, a remix)

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
When I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slippin' away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Tryna grab hold, trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)

(I've, I've, I've)
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

Ayo, one thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shaked, and made eye contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up, you weaken your system
And had to throw it up
I brought you back into things
Like imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt leather, never pleather
Real bringin' the pleasure
By any means, it means I'm leavin' your team
Hell of a team, man, it seems but I tried so hard
(Hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard)

'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall
And hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run, with you mockin' me
Stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now, chock full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory

I've lied to you (To you, to you, to you, to you)
This is the last smile
That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
(For the sake of being with you)
Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

En ohw elpoep eht neve
Neve trapa sllaf gnihtyreve

I've tried, like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
(The sacrifice of hiding in a lie)
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse psychology's failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There's nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes, there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking, ""Why?""

The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me
Why I stay
When you just push away?
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me"
