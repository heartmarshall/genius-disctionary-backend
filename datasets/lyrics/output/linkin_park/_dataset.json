It's like that\n\n[Outro: Brad Delson]\nWe swim against the rising waves\nAnd crash against the shore\nThe body bends until it breaks\nThe early morning sings no more\nSo rest your head, it's time to sleep\nAnd dream of what's in store\nThe body bends until it breaks\nAnd sings again no more\n'Cause time has torn the flesh away\nThe early morning sings no more",

Not one\nSo no, I'm not afraid to see you suckers hold a blade to me\nAin't no way to shake the ground I built before you came to be\nTake it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy\nAnd this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nIn the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose\nAnd there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose\nIn the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears\nWhile the future slips away and your hope turns into fear\nAnd your hope turns into fear in the wastelands of today\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus: Chester Bennington]\nIn the wastelands of today when there's nothing left to lose\nAnd there's nothing more to take, but you force yourself to choose\nIn the wastelands of today where tomorrow disappears\nWhile the future slips away and your hope turns into fear\nAnd your hope turns into fear in the wastelands of today\n\n[Outro: Chester Bennington]\nIn the wastelands of today\nIn the wastelands of today",
