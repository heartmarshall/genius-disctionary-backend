(Oh, oh, oh)\nWhat's love without tragedy?\n\nMother Mary, I swear I wanna change\nMister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen\nBut I'm from the left side of an island\nNever thought this many people would even know my name\nAs time flies way above me\nFor you, I've cried, tears ceding\nOh glory, the prayers carry me\nI'll be a star, you keep directing me\nLet's make the best scene they've ever seen\n\nLet's capture the moment\n'Cause even forever ain't forever\nI swear by the moment\n'Cause together ain't promise forever\nLet's live in the moment\nAs long as we got each other\nDie in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\n'Cause even forever ain't forever\nI swear by the moment\n'Cause together ain't promise forever\nLet's live by the moment\nAs long as we got each other\nDie in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\nTo die in the moment\n\nMother Mary, I swear I wanna change\nMister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen\nBut I'm from the left side of an island\nNever thought this many people would even know my name\nAs time flies way above me\nFor you, I've cried, tears ceding\nOh glory, the prayers carry me\nI'll be a star, you keep directing me\nLet's make the best scene they've ever seen\n\nLet's capture the moment\n'Cause even forever ain't forever\nI swear by the moment\n'Cause together ain't promise forever\nLet's live in the moment\nAs long as we got each other\nDie in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\n'Cause even forever ain't forever\nI swear by the moment\n'Cause together ain't promise forever\nLet's live by the moment\nAs long as we got each other\nDie in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\nTo die in the moment\n\nDie the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\nI'm prepared to die in the moment\n'Cause even forever ain't forever\nI swear by the moment\n'Cause together ain't promise forever\nI'm prepared to die in the moment"
