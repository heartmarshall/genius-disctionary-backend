Long distance, I need you (Ah)
When I see potential, I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it if it's too soon
But I

If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh (Yeah)
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I'm sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face-to-face

You spent some time away
Now you need to forward

Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets

So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"

""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)

And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like

So how will I know I've gone too far?

So pardon if I'm impolite

I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind

You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to say"

Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
Ah, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch, uh
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them, I slit my wrists
At the top is just us, nigga
'Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday""
'Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky
You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh right away
At first sight I felt energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky

What now?

I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now?
Please tell me
What now?

There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout

What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out (Wait it out)
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?

I don't know where to go

I don't know how to cry

This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange

Part I: Love Without Tragedy

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say, ""Oh, it's nothing at all""
Heart's racing, outta control
And you knew, that I couldn't let it go
You used to be, this boy I loved
And I used to be, this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive, injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low

What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy? (Marilyn Monroe)
What's love without tragedy? (Oh, oh, oh)

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change
Mister Jesus, I'd love to be a queen
But I'm from the left side of an island
Never thought this many people would even know my name
As time flies way above me
For you, I've cried, tears ceding
Oh glory, the prayers carry me
I'll be a star, you keep directing me
Let's make the best scene they've ever seen

Let's capture the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live in the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
Let's live by the moment
As long as we got each other
Die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
To die in the moment

Die the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
I'm prepared to die in the moment
'Cause even forever ain't forever
I swear by the moment
'Cause together ain't promise forever
I'm prepared to die in the moment"

I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No worse for wear

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash
)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going

Can't you see?
Ain't it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

I'm going numb, I'm going

I'm plastered (dry wall)
Look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? (no!)
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear
I'm tryna get closer to you
I'm motionin' you to pull over, boo
I'm the siren that you hear (hear)
I'm the butt police and I'm lookin' at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
'Cause I'm sick of sniffin' asphalt
Every thought scarred got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders and I can't feel my lips 'cause—

'Cause I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past, let that man get cash

I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close, boy, 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me callin' out for help

Take on me (Ah-ha), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight
I melt with you, you got me head over heels (Over heels)
