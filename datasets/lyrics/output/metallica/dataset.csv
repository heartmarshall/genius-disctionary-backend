Move, move, move, move, move
Get out of here, oh, fuck
We're all fucking trapped here, we're all fucking trapped here

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, help me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell"

Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye

Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time he will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls"

Wait for the sign to flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, as I watch death unfold
Consciousness, my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?

Death, deliverance for you, for sure
Now there's nothing you can do

So gather 'round, young warriors, now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now's the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts and sweat

Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
Oh yeah, yeah"

Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid

He could just be gone
He would just sail on

Search for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
His sinking life outside its hell
Inside, intoxicating
He's run aground like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with his ship
Fading in the shadows

Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I

Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Takin' no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

I'll spread your blood around, I'll see you writhe

Like a double dozen before you, smells so sweet

Am I evil? Yes, I am

I'll make my residence, I'll watch your fire
You can come with me, sweet desire

Crushed under heavy skies

Circling the sun
Bastardized in ruin

Blame the world and blame your maker
Wish 'em to the undertaker
Crown yourself the other savior

Beaten down and broken

Overload, the martyr stumbles
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles
All alone thy fears shall humble
Swallow all your pride

But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames
Do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still, they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid but the fist I make
For years, can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me, so please excuse me
While I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams (But now the dreams) and waking screams
That ever last the night
So build the wall (So build the wall), behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So, can you hear your babies crying now?
