On a bed of nails she makes me wait

Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you

With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose

And you give yourself away

Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?

You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same

Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day

Teach me

See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few

Say it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

And gold is the reason for the wars we wage

Tells the next one there'll be one more
And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you're really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain's voice
But it's hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore
This is as far as I could reach

If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?

The sea knows where are the rocks
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is
The same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win
And so we end before we begin
Before we begin

If you go
If you go your way and I'll go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby, every dog on the street
Knows that we're in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing
Every breaking wave?"

Love hurts
Now you're the girl who's left with no words
Your heart's a balloon, but then it bursts
It doesn't take a cannon, just a pin
Your skin's not covering and resistance
Love has got to fight for its existence
The enemy has armies of assistance
The amorous, the glamorous, the kiss
A fist, listen to this, oh

Get out of your own way, oh, ah
Get out of your own way, oh, ah

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside
I can help you, but it's your fight, your fight

Fight back
Don't take it lying down, you got to bite back
The face of liberty's starting to crack
She had a plan up until she got a smack in the mouth
And it all went south
Like freedom
The slaves are looking for someone to lead them
The master's looking for someone to need him
The promised land is there for those who need it most
And Lincoln's ghost said

Get out of your own way, oh, ah
Get out of your own way, oh, ah

I could sing it to you all night, all night
If I could, I'd make it alright, alright
Nothing's stopping you except what's inside

Get out of your own way

Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way
Get out of your own way

Blessed are the arrogant
For their's the kingdom of their own company
Blessed are the superstars
For the magnificence in their light
We understand better our own insignificance
Blessed are the filthy rich
For you can only truly own what you give away
Like your pain"

High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul

I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Ah
Shake it out and you slip it in your pocket
Ah, how long, how long?

A star lit up like a cigar
Strung out like a guitar
Maybe you could educate my mind
Explain all these controls
I can't sing, but I've got soul
The goal is elevation

A mole, digging in a hole
Digging up my soul
Now going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

(Hoo-hoo, woo-hoo-hoo)

Love, lift me out of these blues
Won't you tell me something true
I believe in you

Digging up my soul now
Going down, excavation

You make me feel like I can fly
So high, elevation

Elevation

In a person, in a country, when you believe the lie
The lie (The lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action not to fantasy
The end of the dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be my sanctuary?

Above the noise, above the hurt

I was young, not dumb
Just wishing to be blinded
By you, brand new
And we were pilgrims on our way

I woke up at the moment when the miracle occurred
Heard a song that made some sense out of the world
Everything I ever lost now has been returned
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

We got language so we can't communicate
Religion so I can love and hate
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
And give it a name

And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
And take the staircase to the first floor
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls, you can hear the city groan
Outside, it's America
Outside, it's America

See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howling the women and children
Who run into the arms

Of a cross in a passion where the passion is hate

In my dream, I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world

Love, love, love, love love love

His mother takes him by his hand
If he stops to think, he starts to cry
Oh, why?

I was on the inside
When they pulled the four walls down
I was looking through the window
I was lost, I am found

Walk away, walk away

I see you when I go in there

Come all who feel we're not on our own
All UFOs come on your way home
Alone, that's no way to be carrying on
Come on, we're betting on a future that's long
Gone, in luck or in song

Come all who serve above and below
Come all believers and all who don't know
Come quick, come soon, comme ci, comme ça

Sinatra swings, a choir sings
Love is god and god is love
And if your dreams don't scare you, they're not big enough

For everyone

God doesn't play dice
But he likes roulette
The wheel has not stopped
Spinning yet

Where you are is where I'll be
I'm free
So unexpectedly

I'm free
I see what's in front of me
And your freedom is contagious
What you've got I wanna be
I'm free
It took me my whole life
I got the keys to the cages
I'm ready for bright lights
I'm free
I came here for the fight
I'm front row in Las Vegas
And there's a big one on tonight"

Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don't have to go it alone

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

We fight all the time
You and I, that's alright
We're the same soul
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
That if we weren't so alike
You'd like me a whole lot more

I know that we don't talk
I'm sick of it all
Can you hear me when I sing
You're the reason I sing
You're the reason why the opera is in me...

Where are we now?
Still got to let you know
A house doesn't make a home
Don't leave me here alone...

And it's you when I look in the mirror
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it
Best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you can't make it on your own"

You stumble out of a hole in the ground

You could lip-sync to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

Stay, and the day would keep its trust

I was looking for a soul that's real
Then I ran into you
And that cherry blossom tree
Was a gateway to the sun
And friendship, once it's won

Northside just across the river to the Southside
That's a long way here
All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide, the joy you hold
The foolish pride that gets you out the door
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

Sleepwalking down the road
Not waking from these dreams
'Cause it's never dead, it's still my head
It was a war zone in my teens
I'm still standing on that street
Still need an enemy
The worst ones I can't see
You can, you can

Northside just across the river from the Southside

All the green and all the gold
The hurt you hide and the joy you hold
The foolish pride that sends you back for more
Up on Cedarwood, Cedarwood Road

If the door is open, it isn't theft
You can't return to where you've never left
Blossoms falling from a tree
They cover you and cover me
Symbols clashing, Bibles smashing
Paint the world you need to see
