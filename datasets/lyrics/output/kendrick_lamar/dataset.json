Okay, nigga, let's play\nHave you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?\nHave you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?\nWell, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight\nI hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns\nThen hop online like \"Pray for my city,\" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs\nHis daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done\nDementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky\nI'll park his son\nThe very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way\nI didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes\nSomebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage\nI'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave\nCutthroat business, you got shit twisted\nWhat is it? The braids?\nI hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay\nIt's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage\nI love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh\nIt's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh\nI don't wanna talk on no celly, huh\nYou know I got language barriers, huh\nIt's no accent you can sell me, huh\nYeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh\nI pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly\nI don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef\nYeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T\nYou better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me\nHe's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet\nWe ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way\nI know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint\nThis ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest\nIt's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater\nI hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\nI hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct\nWe hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women\nAnd notice, I said \"we,\" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'\nHow many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?\nHow many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?\nI like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough\nYou gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'\nYeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one\nLet your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from\nV12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one\nHeadshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk\n\nRemember?\nAyy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?\nExtortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch\nI'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous\nYachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with\nI hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress\nSurprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address\nI even hate when you say the word \"nigga,\" but that's just me, I guess\nSome shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess\nStill love when you see success, everything with me is blessed\nKeep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat\nI'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet\nMatter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)\nWhen I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches\nI believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em\nLet's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya\nYou were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga\nTry cease and desist on the \"Like That\" record?\nHo, what? You ain't like that record?\n\"Back To Back,\" I like that record\nI'ma get back to that, for the record\nWhy would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?\nThat's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that\nWakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that\nThen tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that\nThen givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that\nTeachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that\nSpeakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that\nAin't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you\nYeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you\nAm I battlin' ghost or AI?\nNigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen\nFunny, he was in a film called\nA.I\nAnd my sixth sense tellin' me to off him\nI'ma blick niggas all in they coffin\nYeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders\nTell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence\nWhat I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it\nPick a nigga off one at a time with it\nWe can be on a three-hour time difference\nDon't speak on the family, crodie\nIt can get deep in the family, crodie\nTalk about me and my family, crodie?\nSomeone gon' bleed in your family, crodie\nI be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie\nTell me you're cheesin', fam\nWe can do this right now on the camera, crodie\nAyy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas\nI wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm\nField goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food\nWhoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too\nIf you take it there, I'm takin' it further\nPsst, that's something you don't wanna do\n\nOoh\nWe don't wanna hear you say \"nigga\" no more\nWe don't wanna hear you say \"nigga\" no more\nStop"

Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance\nWith society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed\nSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out\nAt the same burger stand where **** hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different\nThat was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine\nPakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime\nPack a van with four guns at a time\nWith the sliding door, fuck is up?\nFuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?\nPickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin'

broke loose\nYou killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce\nNow crawl your head in that noose\nYou wind up dead on the news\nAin't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve\nBodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs\nObviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys\nWhen you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct\nMake sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect\nThey say the governor collect all of our taxes, except\nWhen we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat\nYou movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a

him\nSecurity guard for a month and ended up leavin'\nIn fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends\nTo stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in\nProjects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)\nCocaine laced in marijuana\nAnd they wonder why I rarely smoke now\nImagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth\nI was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke

Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton\n\nI'm still in the hood, loc, g-yeah, that's cool\nShit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules\nBut, g-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang\nAnd niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang\nPass it to the left, so I can smoke on me\nA couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah\nCouple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can\nShots in the crowd, then everybody ran\nCrew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave\nShots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave\nMount up, regulators in the whip\nDown the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah\nTrip, we in the hood still\nSo, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah\nDeal with the outcome, a strap in the hand\nAnd a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand\n\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?\nPerceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?\nIf I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage\nKill 'em all if they gossip\nThe Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option\nOf livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins\nConstantly drinkin' and drive\nHit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye\nListen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide\nOut that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes\nProbably go to the projects\nI live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA\nMade me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?\n\n*Scratches*\nM.A.A.d city\nCompton\n\nNigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn\nYou ain't the one that got fucked up\nWhat you holdin' it for?\nNiggas always actin' unsensitive and shit\nNigga, that ain't no word\nNigga, shut up\nHey, Dot, you good, my nigga?\nDon't even trip\nJust lay back and drink that"

If it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot, and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for— ooh\n\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (\nAnd pray to the God\n)\nI hate everything black (\nWe don't believe\n)\nBlack, I want all things black\nI don't need black, I want everything black\nI don't need black, our eyes ain't black\nI own black, I own everything black\n\nSix in the morn'\nFire in the street\nBurn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)\nThat's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)\nAnd sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\nIt's such a shame, they may call me crazy\nThey may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\nBut homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)\nBlack don't crack, my nigga\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n\nI said they treat me like a slave cah me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nI mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\nThat's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me\nCurse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me, don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this Black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n\nI said they treat me like a slave cah me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nWhen I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree\nThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred\nIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justification\nI'm African-American, I'm African\nI'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\nI'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French\nBut fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets\nI know you hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you\nI can tell 'cause your ways deceitful\nKnow I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle\nThinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him\nIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State \"Marcus Garvey got all the answers\"\nOr try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite"

I come from love\nEstelle cover my heart, then open me up\nRemember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust\nTimid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often\nI know this type of power is gon' cost\nBut I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star\nThe mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art\nBut the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart\n\nYeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak'\nEven he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back\nAin't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant\nFuckin' with good people make good people go to bat\nConspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak\nFind the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think\nAre you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see\nHave you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\nCan't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface\nEvery dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose\nIt was fun until you started to put money in the streets\nThen lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts\nI'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace\nBut war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed\nThe Elohim, KTW, know you can't sleep, these images trouble you\nKnow the wires in your circle should puzzle you\nIf you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you\nA hundred niggas that you got on salary\nAnd twenty of 'em want you as a casualty\nAnd one of them is actually next to you\nAnd two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle\nJust don't got the audacity to tell you\nBut let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie\nYou playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya\nYou're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots\nBut your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi\nYour lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out\nThe forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route\nIt's time that you look around on who's around you\nBefore you figure that you're not alone, ask: \"What Mike would do?\""

We never do listen\n'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)\nPlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)\nLookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me\nAnd they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream\nYep, her president is Black, she Black too\nPurple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue\nShe take it straight to the head, then she look at me\nShe got ADHD\n\nEight doobies to the face, fuck that\nTwelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that\nTwo pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance when your age don't exist\n\nLike woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWoah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\n(They always told me ADHD did it)\nWoah, woah-woah\n\nAnd then she started\nAnd then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment\n\"Beg your pardon?

Because we born in the '80s\nThe ADHD crazy\"\n\nEight doobies to the face, fuck that\nTwelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that\nTwo pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance when your age don't exist\n\nLike woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\nWoah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)\n(They always told me ADHD did it)\nWoah, woah-woah\n\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light\nDouble cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite\nEcstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like\nYou can have all my shine, I'll give you the light"

Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\nDo you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?\nCould I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?\nIs your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?\nWould you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?\nIf I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off\nIf the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car\nWould you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?\nOr question my character and degrade me on every blog?\nWant you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson\nI freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome\nYou tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing\nBut a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:\n\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\nThe ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'\nLet my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message\nAs I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd with that—\n\nDo you believe in me? How much you believe in her?\nYou think she gon' stick around if them twenty-five years occur?\nYou think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?\nYou think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?\nCan you be immortalized without your life being expired?\nEven though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time?\nLike, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent?\nHow clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?\nHow tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness?\nWhat brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?\nWhat kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?\nWhat kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned\nYou wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson\nYou wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom\nYou wanna be remembered that delivered the message\nThat considered the blessing of everyone\nThis your lesson for everyone, say:\n\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWon't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\nThe voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'\nLet my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message\nAs I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd if you riding with me, nigga—\n\nI been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues\nI hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you\nThat's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson\nI went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is\nSo I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?\nIs this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?\nSee, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs\nTrees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law\nGeneration X—will I ever be your ex?\nFlaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls\nPut me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all\nIt's respect, but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall\nHow many leaders you said you needed, then left 'em for dead?\nIs it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?\nIs it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin\nIs it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh\n\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\nThat nigga gave us \"Billie Jean,\" you say he touched those kids?\nWhen shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?\n\nThe ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling\nLet my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message\nAs I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression\nAnd if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga\n\n[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar &\n2Pac]\n\"I remember you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusin' my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screamin' in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self-destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went runnin' for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn't stop survivor's guilt\nGoin' back and forth tryin' to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fightin' the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was 'respect'\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don't know, I'm no mortal man\nMaybe I'm just another nigga\"\nShit, and that's all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga,\" but it ain't really a poem\nI just felt like it's somethin' you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—, about a metaphor, actually\nUh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that? What the ground represent?\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\n(Right)\nThat's how I see it, my word is bond\nI see—, and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\n(Right)\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\n(Mhm)\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing\n(Mhm)\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Wealthy\n(Right),\nappetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor\n(Hungry),\nand hungry\nRight\nYou know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like—\nYou know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be—\nThere might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—, they might eat the rich, you know what I'm sayin'?\nA'ight, so let me ask you this, then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that's rich, or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural-born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin', I took the opportunities\nI worked at the m—, the most menial and degradin' job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nUh, I went from havin' somebody managin' me to me hirin' the person that works my management company\n(Right)\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI made myself a millionaire\n(Right),\nI made—, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\n(Mhm)\nI made millions for these movie companies\n(Mhm)\nNow I make millions for, for us (Mm)\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all go—, all good things come to those that stay true\"\n(Right)\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd it was happenin' to me for a reason\nYou know what I'm sayin'? I was noticin'—, shit\nI was punchin' the right buttons and it was happenin'\nSo, it's no problem, you know\nI mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know\n(Hmm)\nI'm finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a—, a fighter at heart, or somebody that, huh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance\nAnd not only me, but it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I'm sayin'? it's in my veins to fight back\nA'ight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fightin' a war—, I'm fightin' a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down\"?\nIn this country, a Black man only have like\nFive years we can exhibit maximum strengthAnd that's right now, while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn thirty, it's like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a Black man in this country\nAnd you don't wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can look around\nYou don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm)\nThat's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of—, of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothin' but turmoil goin' on, so\nI want to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real\nI don't think America know that\nI think America think we was just playin' and it's gonna be some more playin', but it ain't gonna be no playin'\nIt's gonna be murder, you know what I'm sayin'?\nIt's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831\n(Mhm),\nup in this motherfucker\nYou know what I'm sayin'? It's go—, it's gonna happen (Mm)\nThat's crazy, man\nIn my opinion, the only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nA lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out, or where it comes from\nTrip me out sometimes\nBecause it's spirits\nWe ain't even really rappin', we just lettin' our dead homies tell stories for us\n(Damn)\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world\nIt says:\n\"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consumin' its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringin' back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result? Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered\nEndin' the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\n'Pac? 'Pac? 'Pac?"

On the road, bottles and bitches\nYou FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven\nYou even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit\nGuess you thought he'd recover well\nThird surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real\nThen he died, God himself will say, \"You fuckin' failed,\" you ain't try\n\nI know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga\nI know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga\nI know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga\nY'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga\nAnd if this bottle could talk\nI cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault\nFaults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend\nBecause you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed\nI know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'\nAnd that time that— I'm 'bout to hurl\nI'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you\nYou just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof\nShould've killed yo' ass long time ago\nYou should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, \"You gotta go\"\nAnd if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"

Not where I'm from, we all indigenous\nAgainst all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends\nAgainst all odds, I showed up as a gentleman\nI done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific\nPut that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first\nThey like, \"Dot big trippin',\" I just want what I deserve\nWhat bridge they done burnt?

What you doin'?\" — \"Kickin' it.\"\nI shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense\nWith the homies\n(Police sirens)\nBut – they made a right, then made a left\nThen made a right, then another right\nOne lucky night with the homies\n\nK. Dot, you faded, hood?\nYeah, we finally got that nigga faded\nI think he hit the wrong blunt though\nOoh, which one?\nWell, which one he talkin' about?\nI was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it\nI pray he ain't hit that\nNah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one\nGot the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!\nNigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe\nNigga, for what?\nWhat that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?\n\"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!\"\nYeah, yeah, that shit right there\nI'm tryna be the nigga in the street\nThere he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go\nLook, here's the plan, luv\nWe gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park\n'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight\nThat's what he's not gon' do\nThen we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30\nThat's straight, but we should meet up around 12\nI'm tryna fuck on somethin' too\nNigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!\nNigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!\nMatter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!\nWe finna get active!"

I heard they opened up Pandora's box\"\nI box 'em all in, by a landslide\nNah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets\nI make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats\nBut I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay\nHe said, \"It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game\"\n\nI been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo\n\nI remember you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in a hotel room\nI didn't want to self-destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn't stop survivor's guilt\nGoing back and forth\nTrying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war\nBack in the city\nI was entering a new one"

I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith\nCameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make\nMurder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank\nHomies attractin' the feds when I'm brackin', look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)\nLet's think about this for a second (Let's go)\nTell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)\nWould you sell your soul on credit?

    "lyrics": "Que reflejan tu mirada\nLa noche, tú y yo\n\nI got this fire burnin' in me from within\nConcentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin\nEvery day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain\nJuggling the pros and cons of fame\nI don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul\nI recollect this isolation, I was four years old\nTruth be told, I've been battling myself\nTryna navigate the real and fake\nCynical about the judgement day\nI did past life regression last year and it fucked me up\nReincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus\nBody after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947\nMy father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him\nI didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing\nGifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level\nThe most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel\nAnd so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world\nWith my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled\nI found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect\nWhile the record business loved me\nI was head of rhythm and blues\nThe women that fell to they feet, so many to choose\nBut I manipulated power as I lied to the masses\nDied with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated\n\nAnother life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit\nSeductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains\nMy voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed\nA musical genius what the articles emphasized\nHad everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction\nHeroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted\nTurned on my family, I went wherever cameras be\nCocaine, no private planes for my insanity\nSelf-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments\nI needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin\nFuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar\nSex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'\nMy first assistant was a small town scholar\nNever did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her\nMy daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me\nI died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated\n\nMy present life is Kendrick Lamar\nA rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe\nThe only factor I respected was raisin' the bar\nMy instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh\nMy father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him\nI'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'\nEgo and pride had me looking at him with resentment\nI close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious\nI'm yelling, \"Father, did I finally get it right?\" Everything I did was selfless\nI spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them\nI didn't gloat, even told 'em, \"No,\" when the vultures came\nTook control of my fleshly body when the money changed\nSon, you do well, but your heart is closed\nI can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself\nFather, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down\n\"But your pride has to die,\" okay, Father, show me how\nTell me every deed that you done and what you do it for\nI kept one hundred institutions paid\nOkay, tell me more\nI put one hundred hoods on one stage\nOkay, tell me more\nI'm tryna push peace in L.A.\nBut you love war\nNo, I don't\nOh, yes, you do\nOkay, then tell me the truth\nEvery individual is only a version of you\nHow can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?\nI could tell you where I'm going\nI could tell you who you are\nYou fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious\nDidn't like authority, only searched to be heinous\nIsaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent\nMy greatest music director was you\nIt was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues\nIt was harmony and motion\nI sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken\nRehabilitation, not psychosis\nBut now we here now\nCenturies you manipulated man with music\nEmbodied you as superstars to see how you moving\nYou came a long way from garnishing evilish views\nAnd all I ever wanted from you was love and approval\nI learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear\nThe more that word is diminished, the more it's not real\nThe more light that I can capture, the more I can feel\nI'm using words for inspiration as an idea\nSo can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?\nI promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding\nFor every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?\nI vow my life just to live one in harmony now\nYou crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity\nAnd I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy\nThen let's rejoice where we at\nI rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated"
