(
Mustard on the beat, ho
)

Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, ""Breathe, bro""
Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
You better not ever go to cell block one
To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
What is the owl? Bird niggas and burnt bitches, go
The audience not dumb
Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
What OVO for? The ""Other Vaginal Option""? Pussy
Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Say, ""OV-ho"" (
OV-ho
)
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way

Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way"

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’ussé with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

It's levels to it, you and I know

Euphoria

Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard
Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee

Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk

Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called
A.I
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do

Ooh
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear, ""Yawk, yawk, yawk, yawk""

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all, duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
​m.A.A.d. city

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?

It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga?)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the livin' room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, g-yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, g-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, g-yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, g-yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, g-yeah, it's so real, g-yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?

Nigga, that ain't no word

Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that"

Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

""Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I know that you're nauseous right now
and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

All I—, all I—, all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop— yeah, we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' ru— they run opposite way
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
*Car door opens and gunshots are fired*
Aha, got them niggas

Yeah, blood, I'm good, Dave, you good? Dave?

And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case

Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said, ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that""

Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts, Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again, oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

I'm sorry that that man is your father, let me be honest
It takes a man to be a man, your dad is not responsive
I look at him and wish your grandpa would've wore a condom
I'm sorry that you gotta grow up and then stand behind him
Life is hard, I know, the challenge is always gon' beat us home
Sometimes our parents make mistakes that affect us until we grown
And you're a good kid that need good leadership
Let me be your mentor since your daddy don't teach you shit
Never let a man piss on your leg, son
Either you die right there or pop that man in the head, son
Never fall in the escort business, that's bad religion
Please remember, you could be a bitch even if you got bitches
Never code-switch, whether right or wrong, you're a Black man
Even if it don't benefit your goals, do some push-ups, get some discipline
Don't cut them corners like your daddy did, fuck what Ozempic did
Don't pay to play with them Brazilians, get a gym membership
Understand, no throwin' rocks and hidin' hands, that's law
Don't be ashamed 'bout who you wit', that's how he treat your moms
Don't have a kid to hide a kid to hide again, be sure
Five percent will comprehend, but ninety-five is lost
Be proud of who you are, your strength come from within
Lotta superstars that's real, but your daddy ain't one of them
And you nothin' like him, you'll carry yourself as king
Can't understand me right now? Just play this when you eighteen

Dear Sandra
Your son got some habits, I hope you don't undermine them
Especially with all the girls that's hurt inside this climate
You a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment
With emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded
Dear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator
Even using you to prove who he is is a huge favor
I think you should ask for more paper, and more paper
And more, uh, more paper
I'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions
Psychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim
You raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis
Sandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen, mm-mm
Your son's a sick man with sick thoughts; I think niggas like him should die
Him and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest they life
He hates Black women, hypersexualize 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish
Grew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better
He got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance
A child should never be compromised, and he keepin' his child around them
And we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'
Fuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose
I been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret
It's some weird shit goin' on, and some of these artists be here to police it
They be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender
Then leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas
To any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister
Or better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones
Katt Williams said, ""Get you the truth,"" so I'ma get mines
The Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time
Ayy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away
To anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away
They lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away
I'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe

Dear baby girl
I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world
He don't commit to much, but his music, yeah, that's for sure
He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs
Try destroyin' families rather than taking care of his own
Should be teaching you time tables or watchin'
Frozen
with you
Or at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you
Instead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve
I wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind
You got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind
'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion
Money's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to
His father prolly didn't claim him neither
History do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason
But I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child
Give him grace, this the reason I made
Mr. Morale
So our babies like you can cope later
Give you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later
I never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior
Sittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation
You need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain
I'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains
Yes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right
And a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say ""more life""
Meet the Grahams

Dear Aubrey
I know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party
But truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body
This supposed to be a good exhibition within the game
But you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name
Why you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?
Guess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you
And I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home
Thirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old
You got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems
Bad with money, whorehouse
Solicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start
But I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom
I try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'
Crave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'
No dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in
No secret handshakes with your friend
No culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother
Identity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya
The skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas
Can't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman
You a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?
You embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us
Take that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements
Why believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in
'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery
You lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury
You lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members
They all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em
You lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh
You lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come
You lied about the only artist that can offer you some help
Fuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"

Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say (Oh yeah)

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (
Oh yeah
)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

(
In the thundering rain
)
I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, it's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day, when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof

I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steerin'
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhm

Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"

Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this mornin' and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothin' but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes, it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [

To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it
Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I gotta fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter of fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, bullshit
And when I die...

When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passin' away? If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot, and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

The same song, uh, a black flower, uh
I'll show you how to, uh

Dye your thirst, uh
Dye your thirst, uh
Dye your thirst, uh

What are we doin', uh? Who are we foolin', uh?
Hell is hot, uh, fire is proven, uh
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it, uh
Tired of runnin', uh, choirs is hummin', uh
Tell us to visit, uh, we lie about comin', uh
Now back to business, uh, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', uh, it's no discussion, uh
Hereditary, uh, all of my cousins, uh

Dyin' of thirst, uh
Dyin' of thirst, uh
Dyin' of thirst, uh

Too many sins, uh, I'm runnin' out, uh
Somebody send me a well for the drought, uh
See all I know, uh, is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke, uh
My best days, uh, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, uh, I stress days, uh
Say ""fuck the world,"" uh, my sex slave, uh
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave, uh
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', uh, tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""

Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus for saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus for saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life, your real life"

Lalah Hathaway
]
Everything black, I don't want black (
They want us to bow
)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (
Down to our knees
)
Some white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (
And pray to the God
)
I hate everything black (
We don't believe
)
Black, I want all things black
I don't need black, I want everything black
I don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, I own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this Black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

Because you make me live forever, baby

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved
Like a rebound, no control
No off switch in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
How did it all go to feel good?
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We been runnin' out of time

Love, let's talk about love (
Let's talk about love, is

Is it anything and everything you hoped for? (
Anything, oh, oh, this

Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt;
haunt, haunt

I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know

But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care,
I care

Hell-raisin’, wheel-chasin', new worldly possessions
Flesh-makin', spirit-breakin', which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hopin’ I make a band
I understand I ain’t perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain’t give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin' with cold thumb
I'm willin’ to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care,
I care

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care,
I care

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)
Maybe I wasn't there"

Now

When I was twenty-seven, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated ten times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At twenty-seven, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
Thirty shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At twenty-seven years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of AmericaI love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you
Shalom"

It's survival, survival
I think somebody lying
Smell somebody lying
I don't see no fire

Off-white Sunseeker at the marina
Fuck a Phantom, I like to buy yachts when I get the fever
Wine cooler spill on my white t-shirt, the sightseer
Trifecta, money, morals, and culture, that's my leisure
My visa, passport tatted, I show up in Ibiza
Lucalis dwellings in Brooklyn just to book me some pizza
Who could reach us? Only God could teleport this type of freedom
God, ah, my confession is yours
But, who am I if I don't go to war?
There's opportunity when livin' with loss
I discover myself when I fall short
Raise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize
Me jumpin' planets immortalized, I correspond
Three angels watchin' me all the time
Put my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes
Definition of peace
Tell me who gon' stop me? I come from love
Estelle cover my heart, then open me up
Remember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust
Timid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often
I know this type of power is gon' cost
But I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star
The mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal and give you art
But the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart

Yeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak'
Even he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back
Ain't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant
Fuckin' with good people make good people go to bat
Conspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak
Find the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think
Are you finally ready to play have-you-ever? Let's see
Have you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?
Fake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person
Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it
Can't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface
Every dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose
It was fun until you started to put money in the streets
Then lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts
I'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace
But war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed
The Elohim, KTW, know you can't sleep, these images trouble you
Know the wires in your circle should puzzle you
If you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you
A hundred niggas that you got on salary
And twenty of 'em want you as a casualty
And one of them is actually next to you
And two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle
Just don't got the audacity to tell you
But let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie
You playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya
You're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots
But your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi
Your lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out
The forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route
It's time that you look around on who's around you
Before you figure that you're not alone, ask: ""What Mike would do?"""

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""
""You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy""

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends

You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though y'all share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest? Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in? Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn? Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect, but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed, then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Spoken Outro: Kendrick Lamar &
2Pac]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusin' my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Goin' back and forth tryin' to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fightin' the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was 'respect'
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigga""
Shit, and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga,"" but it ain't really a poem
I just felt like it's somethin' you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa—, about a metaphor, actually
Uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that? What the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
(Right)
That's how I see it, my word is bond
I see—, and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
(Right)
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
(Mhm)
And they gonna be so appetizing
(Mhm)
You know what I'm sayin'? Wealthy
(Right),
appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor
(Hungry),
and hungry
Right
You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be like—
You know what I'm sayin'? It's gonna be—
There might—, there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu—, they might eat the rich, you know what I'm sayin'?
A'ight, so let me ask you this, then
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich, or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural-born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin', I took the opportunities
I worked at the m—, the most menial and degradin' job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
Uh, I went from havin' somebody managin' me to me hirin' the person that works my management company
(Right)
I changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm sayin'?
I made myself a millionaire
(Right),
I made—, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies
(Mhm)
I made millions for these movie companies
(Mhm)
Now I make millions for, for us (Mm)
And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in ""all go—, all good things come to those that stay true""
(Right)
You know what I'm sayin'?
And it was happenin' to me for a reason
You know what I'm sayin'? I was noticin'—, shit
I was punchin' the right buttons and it was happenin'
So, it's no problem, you know
I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know
(Hmm)
I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a—, a fighter at heart, or somebody that, huh, somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance
And not only me, but it goes down my family tree
You know what I'm sayin'? it's in my veins to fight back
A'ight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
""We fightin' a war—, I'm fightin' a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down""?
In this country, a Black man only have like
Five years we can exhibit maximum strengthAnd that's right now, while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn thirty, it's like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a Black man in this country
And you don't wanna fight no more
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm)
That's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of—, of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that there's nothin' but turmoil goin' on, so
I want to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real
I don't think America know that
I think America think we was just playin' and it's gonna be some more playin', but it ain't gonna be no playin'
It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm sayin'?
It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831
(Mhm),
up in this motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin'? It's go—, it's gonna happen (Mm)
That's crazy, man
In my opinion, the only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out, or where it comes from
Trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits
We ain't even really rappin', we just lettin' our dead homies tell stories for us
(Damn)
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world
It says:
""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
While consumin' its environment, the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringin' back new concepts to this mad city
The result? Wings begin to emerge, breakin' the cycle of feelin' stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered
Endin' the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
They are one and the same""
What's your perspective on that?
'Pac? 'Pac? 'Pac?"

Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas? Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hundred-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

I swear, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

Loving you, loving you, not loving you, 100 proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

What I got to do to get to you?
To you, and—

And you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try

I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time that— I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk, it'll say, ""You gotta go""
And if I told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness"

With a bone to pick like it was sea bass

Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
!
We gon' put it in reverse

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
God is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

La noche de anoche
Y nos ponemos a llorar

Yesterday somebody whacked out my mural
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe
But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure
The love and hate is definite without a cure
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
I done been through it all, what you endure?
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural
Fuck everybody, that's on my body
My blick first, then God got me
I watch 'em pandеr with them back-handed compliments
Put thеy head on a Cuban link as a monument
I paid homage and I always mind my business
I made the—
I never lost who I am for a rap image
It's motivation if you wonder how I did it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
Never let no one put smut up on your name
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you

Que reflejan tu mirada
La noche, tú y yo

Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love
Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up
Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
Used to bump
Tha Carter III
, I held my Rollie chain proud
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first
They like, ""Dot big trippin',"" I just want what I deserve
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with
I'm doin' what COVID did, they'll never get over it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
Never let no one put smut up on your name
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
A couple rules of engagements, here to guide you

Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy
Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
I'll never peace it up, that shit don't sit well with me
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious
It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television
Teleport to Bullis Road and dig up all my relatives
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now
You niggas live in denial
Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style
Exterminate 'em right now
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off
Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?
Well, I did
Whacked the murals out, but it ain't no legends if my legend ends"

The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?

It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""

I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs"

Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated

Walls feelin' like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Lookin' at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
(
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
)
Oh, oh

If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall tellin' you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin', no callin' CO
No callin' your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin' me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin' the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls tellin' you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusin' my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin' life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room"

Everybody sit yo bitch-ass down
And listen to this true mothafuckin' story
Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

Smokin' on the finest dope, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ayy-ayy-ayy-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)
One day it's gon' burn you out (
Woo
)
One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Rémy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!

I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called: ""Hello? What you doin'?"" — ""Kickin' it.""
I shoulda told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense
With the homies
(Police sirens)
But – they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!
We finna get active!"

Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'

Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump

And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'

Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination

Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh

Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind

On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s

And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite

And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased

Really too vicious, the permanent beast

Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh, you ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah), you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)
Huh, who you think they talk about? Talk about us (You outta pocket; shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt) Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh, you ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah), you steppin' or what? (You outta pocket)

Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attractin' the feds when I'm brackin', look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (
Let's go
)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (
Let's go

Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (
Let's go

Huh, huh, huh, you outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dog?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dog
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)"

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of
Martin
go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on

Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping
College Dropout
, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Woah
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Woah
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah, I’m just fuckin’ with you)

I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved

I feel like all of y'all is desperate

Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?

Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust

Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

La noche, tú y yo

I got this fire burnin' in me from within
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain
Juggling the pros and cons of fame
I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul
I recollect this isolation, I was four years old
Truth be told, I've been battling myself
Tryna navigate the real and fake
Cynical about the judgement day
I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up
Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus
Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947
My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him
I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing
Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level
The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel
And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world
With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled
I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect
While the record business loved me
I was head of rhythm and blues
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated

Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit
Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed
A musical genius what the articles emphasized
Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be
Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments
I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin
Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'
My first assistant was a small town scholar
Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her
My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated

My present life is Kendrick Lamar
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe
The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment
I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious
I'm yelling, ""Father, did I finally get it right?"" Everything I did was selfless
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
I didn't gloat, even told 'em, ""No,"" when the vultures came
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself
Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down
""But your pride has to die,"" okay, Father, show me how
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for
I kept one hundred institutions paid
Okay, tell me more
I put one hundred hoods on one stage
Okay, tell me more
I'm tryna push peace in L.A.
But you love war
No, I don't
Oh, yes, you do
Okay, then tell me the truth
Every individual is only a version of you
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?
I could tell you where I'm going
I could tell you who you are
You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious
Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent
My greatest music director was you
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
It was harmony and motion
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
Rehabilitation, not psychosis
But now we here now
Centuries you manipulated man with music
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
I'm using words for inspiration as an idea
So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?
I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now
You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity
And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy
Then let's rejoice where we at
I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated"

I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we live or not
Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone

Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (Diamonds all appraised)
And I'm bossing up (And I'm bossing up)
Bitch, get out the way (Bitch, get out the way)
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie

Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long

Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams

(
What's up, my nigga?
)

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(
Hello, Billy
)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin', I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)

Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep, all day, ""Mortal Man"" and ""Kunta""
Alright, from the top"

Woke up lookin' for the broccoli
High-key, keep a horn on me, that Kamasi
IP, ownership, the blueprint is by me
Mr. Get Off, I get off and mop feet
When I hear music, it makes me dance
You got the music, now is your chance
A yee nigga couldn't try me in the tri-state
Buddy pass, bet I get him splashed 'til he hydrated
Bounce out, know he spook town, eyes dilated
I got the money and the power both gyratin'

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but shе don't got no taste
I walk in, walked out with the safе
Mando, let me know what the play

What the fuck?
I got hits, I got bucks, I got new paper cuts
I got friends, I got foes, but they all sitting ducks
Hit his turf and get crackin', double back like a deluxe
Fifty deep, but it ain't deep enough
Fuck a plea, there he go, beat him up
Fallin' from a money tree and it grow throughout the months
Spit a loogie at the camera, speed off, yeah, it's us

I feel good, get the fuck out my face
Look good, but she don't got no taste

Work on the floor, let me know if you clockin' it
Brodie won't go, but I know that he poppin' it
It was wolf tickets on sale 'til I silenced it
Pipe down, young, these some whole other politics
Bitch with him and some bitch in him, that's a lot of bitch
Don't hit him, he got kids with him, my apologies
Ghetto child, it was Blacky Milds with the Smirnoff
Yeehaw, we outside, whoadie 'bout to kill him off
Blaps on blaps, it's a fact, this a brick of raw
Tell me why the fuck you niggas rap if it's fictional?
Tell me why the fuck you niggas fed if you criminal?
""Ayy, Dot, can I get a drop?"" I'm like, ""Nigga, nah""

Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine comin' through my blinds, I'm livin', but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Livin' in California, everybody wanna visit for

Women, weed and weather
They come for
women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
women, weed and weather

These niggas'll kill for that
Put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that
Me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside?
H-A-T-E in your eyes
I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess
For a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

You might catch me in Atlanta lookin' like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'

Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be livin' in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
""Ribbon In The Sky"" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California livin' 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start, uh
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks
Let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controllin' my price?
No way, hell nah, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts

That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

Hey, uh, known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, motherfuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killin' 'em? Shit, right around a billion, hey
We on it, that mean we livin' for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the mornin', time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controllin'
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fuckin' with this

They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
And eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first—Cali

When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom

Life, can be like, a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:

""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:

""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said

""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"
