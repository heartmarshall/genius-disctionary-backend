    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSeven weeks have passed now since she left me\nShe shows her face to ask me how I am\nShe says the kids are fine, that they miss me\nMaybe I could come and baby-sit sometime\nShe says, \"Are you O.K.? I was worried about you\nCan you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy.\" I said\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears\n\n[Verse 2]\nI saw a friend of mine\nHe said, \"I was worried about you\nI heard she had another man\nI wondered how you felt about it?\" I said\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears\n\n[Verse 3]\nSaw my lawyer, Mr Good News\nHe got me joint custody and legal separation\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears\nI'm laughing through my tears\n\n[Verse 4]\nI took a walk alone last night\nI looked up at the stars\nTo try and find an answer in my life\nI chose a star for me\nI chose a star for him\nI chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife\nSomething made me smile\nSomething seemed to ease the pain\nSomething about the universe and how it's all connected\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream\nWe try to do the best within the given time\nA kid should be with his mother\nEverybody knows that\nWhat can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?\n\n[Outro]\nI saw that friend of mine, he said\n\"You look different somehow\"\nI said, \"Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears\nI'm laughing through my tears\n\nI'm so happy that I can't stop crying\nI'm laughing through my tears\nI'm laughing through my tears",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen a man of my age shaves his face in the morning\nWho is it that stares back and greets him?\nThe ghost of his father long dead all these years?\nOr the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?\nOr the terrible sum of all of his fears\nIn the eyes of this stranger who meets him?\nSo his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline\nTo face up to the truth of his soul\nIt's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge\nSomething strange, unexpected, out of control\nThere are times when a man needs to brave his reflection\nAnd face what he sees without fear\nIt takes a man to accept his mortality\nOr be surprised by the presence of a tear\nIt was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement\nI forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook\nDon't be fooled by illusions you created yourself\nAnd fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a covering of snow on a winter's night\nIt glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight\nBut it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts\nYou still love her but she loves someone else\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd where does that leave you?\nYou self-styled man of vision\nYou feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?\nTo destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission?\nLike a pantomime villain with an axe to grind?\nTo regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man\nUse the ice around your heart before it melts\nBut you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a covering of snow on a winter's night\nIt glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight\nBut it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts\nAnd still you still love her but she loves someone else",
