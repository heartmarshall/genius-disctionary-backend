And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He doesn't play for respect

He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape, shape of my heart

​​

And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart"

I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York

See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien

If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say

Whoa

Whoa

Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

If ""manners maketh man"" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say

See the west wind move like a lover so

Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth

I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down

There's a growing feeling of hysteria
Conditioned to respond to all the threats
In the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets
Mr. Khrushchev said, ""We will bury you""
I don't subscribe to this point of view
It would be such an ignorant thing to do
If the Russians love their children too

How can I save my little boy
From Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
There is no monopoly of common sense
On either side of the political fence

We share the same biology
Regardless of ideology
Believe me when I say to you
I hope the Russians love their children too

There is no historical precedent
To put the words in the mouth of the president
There's no such thing as a winnable war
It's a lie we don't believe anymore
Mr. Reagan says, ""We will protect you""
I don't subscribe to this point of view
Believe me when I say to you

You wake the morning in a stranger's coat

My only friend, who could it be

I hate to say it, but it's probably me

When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real
And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal
You search the city for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, who's watched for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set me free
I had to say it
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

You're not the easiest person I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show
Some would say I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
If there's one guy, just one guy
Who'd lay down his life for you and die
I Hate to say It
I hate to say it, but it's probably me

When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
And the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see

I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you"

To challenge me, woe is me

Well we'll see

I don't think she'd bluff this time

Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait

The fact he's over six feet ten
Might instill fear in other men
But not in me
The mighty flea

Ask if I am mouse or man
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
He'll murder me
In time for his tea

Does it bother me at all
My rival is Neanderthal
It makes me think
Perhaps I need a drink

IQ is no problem here
We won't be playing Scrabble for
Her hand I fear
I need that beer

And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back

Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands

Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common thief

Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one

I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light"

Without your love would it shine for me?
If I was smart as Aristotle
And understood the rings around the moon
What would it all matter if you loved me?

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing would I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancing's end

If I caught the world in an hourglass
Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, Until...

One day you’ll meet a stranger
And all the noise is silenced in the room
You’ll feel that you're close to some mystery
In the moonlight and everything shatters
You feel as if you’ve known her all your life
The world’s oldest lesson in history

Here in your arms where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfil
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms when everything seems to be clear
Not a solitary thing do I fear
Except when this moment comes near the dancing’s end

I see faces as they pass
Beneath the pale lamplight
I've no choice but to follow that call
The bright lights, the people
And the moon and all
I pray everyday to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

It was many years ago
That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon
The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street

She walks everyday through
The streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young
From a family of means
I have stood many times
Outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct
In the pale moon light
How could I be this way
When I pray to god above
I must love what I destroy
And destroy the thing I love

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon over Bourbon Street"

Comes to pay her respects, but her mind is awhirl
When she finds the tomb empty, the stone had been rolled
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold
When she reaches the door, sees an unholy sight
There's this solitary figure in a halo of light
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill
In an almighty hurry, aye but she might catch him still
""Tell me where are you going Lord, and why in such haste?""
Now don't hinder me woman, I've no time to waste!
For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon
And I have to be there before daybreak
Oh, I can not be missing, the lads will expect me
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me?
For nothing will stop me, I have to prevail
Through the teeth of this tempest, in the mouth of a gale
May the angels protect me if all else should fail

And the last ship sails

Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea

And the last ship sails

It's a strange kind of beauty
It's cold and austere
And whatever it was that you've done to be here
It's the sum of your hopes, your despairs and your fears

And the last ship sails

Well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazar's Feast
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest
And the sad ghosts of men whom they'd thought long deceased
And whatever got said, they'd be counted at least

And the last ship sails

Oh, the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers
The noise at the end of the world in your ears
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea
And the last ship sails
And whatever you'd promised, whatever you've done
And whatever the station in life you've become
In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son
And whatever the weave of this life that you've spun
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun

Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls that I'd once made
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
Had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire"

To talk of many things
Of ships and shoes and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings

Life a the greatest gift given to humanity
Surround yourself with a lot a positive energy
Yuh can't buy it even if yuh have whole heap a money
And dat's why we spread love ina the community
Yuh coulda be small man or a celebrity
Yuh coulda live uptown or di inner city
We need a world full peace and serenity

The time has come, as Shaggy said
To talk of many things
Of ships and shoes and sealing wax
Of cabbages and kings

The planets turn in retrograde
The moon seems to have fled
The world is spinning upside down
And landed on its head

Just one lifetime
And there's only one, yes there's only one
Just one life to live
Assuming that we'll make it
We've no choice but to take it

I'm with you, the Walrus said
We'll dress for heavy weather
Whatever's on the road ahead
We're in this now together

We thought we'd make a run for it
Not knowing where we're headed
We packed the car with both our bags
And filled her up unleaded

Just one lifetime
And there's only one, yes there's only one
Just one life to live
Assuming that we'll make it
We've no choice but to take it

Come make we take a page out a di book of life
Leggo negativity and do what's right
We no longer need fi a fuss or fight
Unite the world and show dem di right
Dis generation a set a new trend
Replace di word enemy wid friend
Leaders a di world these rules can't bend
Dis a di message we a send to dem

The time had come, a reckoning
We all knew it was coming
We headed North on empty roads
The engine gently humming

The Walrus smoked a cigarette
He claimed it was his last
No signs of life, no gas, no food
In all the empty towns we passed

All we have is me and you
It has to be enough
I've got your back and you've got mine
If the going it gets rough

Just one lifetime
And there's only one, yes there's only one
Just one life to live
Assuming that we'll make it
We've no choice but to take it

With a smile upon my face
It's still there while I shave my chin
But the reason's hard for me to trace
I cook myself some breakfast
Have some coffee while I muse
Where could this smile have come from?
It's a muscle that I rarely use

Call the doctor with my symptoms
Should I spend all day in bed?
Can you explain what's ailing me?
And that is what my doctor said

If it's love, it has no season
If it's love, there is no cure
If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's lovе, you must surrender (You must surrendеr)
If it's love that's turned you 'round (That's turned you 'round)
If it's love, the odds are slender (The odds are)
If it's love, you're sunk without a trace
One case can bring you down

You smile and your heart skips a beat
You hear a church bell chiming
A sound that's ringing in your ears
Will set your hearbeat climbing

And my doctor's diagnosis?
His opinion, and I quote
""I'll write you a prescription""
And this is what my doctor wrote

If it's love, it has no season
If it's love, there is no cure
If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's love, you must surrender (You must surrender)
If it's love then you must yield (Then you must yield)
If it's love, the odds are slender (The odds are)
If it's love, the trap's already laid
And I'm afraid your fate is all but sealed"

When the stars assume their patterns
And the day has made his journey
And we wondered just what happened
To the life we knew before the world changed
When not a thing I held was true
But you were kind to me and you reminded me
That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting
My illusions all would shatter
But you stayed in my corner
The only world I know was upside down
And now the world and me, I know you carry me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We could be lost we could refuse to try
But we made it through in the dark night
Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me

I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different, you showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure
But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game
And you could've made it through
But your funny friend and me

You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet and that bigger guy
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry
Just like the patterns in the big sky
We'll be together till the end is nigh
Don't know the answer or the reason why
We'll stick together till the day we die
If I had to do this all a second time
I won't complain or make a fuss
Who would the angels send but that unlikely blend
Of those two funny friends
That's us"

I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head

I set off running to wake from the dream
And my brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head

Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head"

If somebody up there cares
Deliver me from evil
Save me from these wicked snares
Not into temptation
Not to cliffs to fall
On to revelation
Lessons for us all
She walks into the room
On the arm of my best friend
I knew whatever happened
Our friendship would end
A chemical reaction
Desire at first sight
Mystical attraction
Turned out all my lights

The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die

I don't know if it's pain
Or pleasure that I seek
My flesh was all too willing
My spirit guide was weak
I was deadly certain
These thoughts for me weren't kind
A switchblade in his pocket
Murder on his mind
Blessed St. Theresa
The whore of Babylon
Madonna and my mother
All rolled into one
You've got to understand me
I'm not a piece of wood
Francis of Assisi
Could never be this good

The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(The less I need the more I get)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
(Make me chaste but not just yet)
The minute I saw her face
The second I caught her eye
(It's a promise or a lie)
The minute I touched the flame
I knew it would never die
(I'll repent before I die)

Relax, have a cigar, make yourself at home. Hell is full of high court
Judges, failed saints. We've got Cardinals, Archbishops, barristers
Certified accountants, music critics, they're all here. You're not alone
You're never alone, not here you're not. OK break's over

Our blood has stained the coal
We tunneled deep inside the nation's soul
We matter more than pounds and pence
Your economic theory makes no sense

And bury the waste in a great big hole

Grimy faces were never seen
But deadly for twelve thousand years

We work the black seam together
We work the black seam together

The seam lies underground
Three million years of pressure packed it down
We walk through ancient forest lands
And light a thousand cities with our hands

Your dark satanic mills
Have made redundant all our mining skills
You can't exchange a six inch band
For all the poisoned streams in Cumberland

The turning world will sing their souls to sleep
When you have sunk without a trace
The universe will suck me into place

The geese are flying south, it sets me thinking
I did not miss you much, I did not suffer
What did not kill me just made me tougher

I feel the winter come, his icy sinews
Now in the firelight, the case continues
Another night in court, the same old trial
The same old questions asked, the same denial

The shadows close me round, like jury members
I look for answers in the fire's embers
Why was I missing then, that whole December?
I give my usual line: I don't remember

Another winter comes, his icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine, these memories never sleep
And all these differences, a cloak I borrow
We kept our distances, why should it follow
That I must have loved you?

What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
I never could find a place to hide
What moves the Earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail
A mast without a sail

The moon's a fingernail and slowly sinking
Another day begins and now I'm thinking
That this indifference was my invention
When everything I did sought your attention
You were my compass star, you were my measure
You were a pirate's map of buried treasure
If this was all correct, the last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests, it's time that I confess:
I must have loved you

I must have loved you"

He said, ""I was worried about you
I heard she had another man
I wondered how you felt about it?"" I said

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears

Saw my lawyer, Mr Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

I took a walk alone last night
I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me
I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother
Everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?

I saw that friend of mine, he said
""You look different somehow""
I said, ""Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime""

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears"
"50","I Love Her But She Loves Someone Else","Sting","The Last Ship","","September 20, 2013","5974","311","34","","https://genius.com/Sting-i-love-her-but-she-loves-someone-else-lyrics","389599","When a man of my age shaves his face in the morning
Who is it that stares back and greets him?
The ghost of his father long dead all these years?
Or the boy that he was, still wet in the ears?
Or the terrible sum of all of his fears
In the eyes of this stranger who meets him?
So his glance rarely strays from his chin or his jawline
To face up to the truth of his soul
It's the eyes he avoids so afraid to acknowledge
Something strange, unexpected, out of control
There are times when a man needs to brave his reflection
And face what he sees without fear
It takes a man to accept his mortality
Or be surprised by the presence of a tear
It was only an arrangement, a practical arrangement
I forgot the first commandment of the realist's handbook
Don't be fooled by illusions you created yourself
And fall in love with someone, when she loves someone else

Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts
You still love her but she loves someone else

And where does that leave you?
You self-styled man of vision
You feel stupid, you feel angry, are you losing your mind?
To destroy the one she loves, does that become your mission?
Like a pantomime villain with an axe to grind?
To regain your self-respect, hold your head up like a man
Use the ice around your heart before it melts
But you're not fooling anybody, you're only fooling yourself

Like a covering of snow on a winter's night
It glistens and it sparkles in the moonlight
But it's gone by the morning, how quickly it melts
And still you still love her but she loves someone else"
