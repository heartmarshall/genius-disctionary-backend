I'm the Acid Queen\nI'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine\nRidin' in the back seat next to my wife\nHeaded straight on in to the afterlife\nI'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap\nOh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap\nWhere we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give\nWe're right down the street, from the street where you live\nThey mutilated his body and they took out his brain\nWhat more could they do? They piled on the pain\nBut his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at\nFor the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that\nFreedom, oh freedom, freedom over me\nI hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free\nSend me some lovin', then tell me no lie\nThrow the gun in the gutter and walk on by\nWake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive\nCross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive\nTurn the radio on, don't touch the dials\nParkland Hospital, only six more miles\nYou got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead\nThat magic bullet of yours has gone to my head\nI'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline\nNever shot anyone from in front or behind\nI've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear\nI'm never gonna make it to the new frontier\nZapruder's film, I've seen that before\nSeen it thirty-three times, maybe more\nIt's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean\nUgliest thing that you ever have seen\nThey killed him once and they killed him twice\nKilled him like a human sacrifice\nThe day that they killed him, someone said to me, \"Son\nThe age of the Antichrist has just only begun\"\nAir Force One comin' in through the gate\nJohnson sworn in at 2:38\nLet me know when you decide to throw in the towel\nIt is what it is, and it's murder most foul\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat's new, pussycat? What'd I say?\nI said the soul of a nation been torn away\nAnd it's beginning to go into a slow decay\nAnd that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day\nWolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues\nHe's going on and on at the top of his lungs\nPlay me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack\nPlay it for me in my long Cadillac\nPlay me that \"Only the Good Die Young\"\nTake me to the place Tom Dooley was hung\nPlay \"St. James Infirmary\" in the Court of King James\nIf you want to remember, you better write down the names\nPlay Etta James, too, play \"I'd Rather Go Blind\"\nPlay it for the man with the telepathic mind\nPlay John Lee Hooker, play \"Scratch My Back\"\nPlay it for that strip club owner named Jack\nGuitar Slim going down slow\nPlay it for me and for Marilyn Monroe\n\n[Verse 5]\nPlay \"Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\"\nPlay it for the First Lady, she ain't feeling any good\nPlay Don Henley, play Glenn Frey\nTake it to the limit and let it go by\nPlay it for Carl Wilson, too\nLooking far, far away down Gower Avenue\nPlay \"Tragedy\", play \"Twilight Time\"\nTake me back to Tulsa to the scene of the crime\nPlay another one and \"Another One Bites the Dust\"\nPlay \"The Old Rugged Cross\" and \"In God We Trust\"\nRide the pink horse down that long, lonesome road\nStand there and wait for his head to explode\nPlay \"Mystery Train\" for Mr. Mystery\nThe man who fell down dead like a rootless tree\nPlay it for the reverend, play it for the pastor\nPlay it for the dog that got no master\nPlay Oscar Peterson, play Stan Getz\nPlay \"Blue Sky,\" play Dickey Betts\nPlay Art Pepper, Thelonious Monk\nCharlie Parker and all that junk\nAll that junk and \"All That Jazz\"\nPlay something for the Birdman of Alcatraz\nPlay Buster Keaton, play Harold Lloyd\nPlay Bugsy Siegel, play Pretty Boy Floyd\nPlay the numbers, play the odds\nPlay \"Cry Me a River\" for the Lord of the gods\nPlay Number nine, play Number six\nPlay it for Lindsey and Stevie Nicks\nPlay Nat King Cole, play \"Nature Boy\"\nPlay \"Down in the Boondocks\" for Terry Malloy\nPlay \"It Happened One Night\" and \"One Night of Sin\"\nThere's twelve million souls that are listening in\nPlay \"Merchant of Venice\", play \"Merchants of Death\"\nPlay \"Stella by Starlight\" for Lady Macbeth\nDon't worry, Mr. President, help's on the way\nYour brothers are comin', there'll be hell to pay\nBrothers?

He ain't the guy!”\n\n[Chorus]\nHere’s the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\n\n[Verse 6]\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\nRubin’s in South America, fighting for his name\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him\nLookin' for somebody to blame\n\n[Chorus]\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw\nRunning that night?”\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\n\n[Verse 7]\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\nThe cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\nWe got you for the motel job, and we’re talking to your friend Bello\nNow you don’t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\n\n[Chorus]\nYou’ll be doing society a favor\nThat son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver\nWe want to put his ass in stir\nWe want to pin this triple murder\nOn him\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\n\n[Verse 8]\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\n\"It’s my work\", he’d say, \"and I do it for pay\"\n\"And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\"\n\n[Chorus]\nUp to some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\n\n[Verse 9]\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\n\n[Verse 10]\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\nThe crime was murder “one”, guess who testified?\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\n\n[Chorus]\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed\nTo live in a land where justice is a game\n\n[Verse 11]\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink Martinis, and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\nAn innocent man in a living hell\n\n[Chorus / Outro]\nYes that’s the story of the Hurricane\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nEarly one morning the sun was shining\nI was laying in bed\nWondering if she'd changed at all\nIf her hair was still red\nHer folks they said our lives together\nSure was going to be rough\nThey never did like Mama's homemade dress\nPapa's bankbook wasn't big enough\nAnd I was standing on the side of the road\nRain falling on my shoes\nHeading out for the East Coast\nLord knows I've paid some dues\nGetting through\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe was married when we first met\nSoon to be divorced\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess\nBut I used a little too much force\nWe drove that car as far as we could\nAbandoned it out west\nSplit up on a dark sad night\nBoth agreeing it was best\nShe turned around to look at me\nAs I was walking away\nI heard her say over my shoulder\n\"We'll meet again someday\nOn the avenue\"\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 3]\nI had a job in the great north woods\nWorking as a cook for a spell\nBut I never did like it all that much\nAnd one day the ax just fell\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\nWhere I lucky was to be employed\nWorking for a while on a fishing boat\nRight outside of Delacroix\nBut all the while I was alone\nThe past was close behind\nI seen a lot of women\nBut she never escaped my mind\nAnd I just grew\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe was working in a topless place\nAnd I stopped in for a beer\nI just kept looking at the side of her face\nIn the spotlight, so clear\nAnd later on, when the crowd thinned out\nI was just about to do the same\nShe was standing there, in back of my chair\nSaid, \"Tell me, don't I know your name?\"\nI muttered something underneath my breath\nShe studied the lines on my face\nI must admit, I felt a little uneasy\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces\nOf my shoe\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 5]\nShe lit a burner on the stove\nAnd offered me a pipe\n\"I thought you'd never say hello,\" she said\n\"You look like the silent type\"\nThen she opened up a book of poems\nAnd handed it to me\nWritten by an Italian poet\nFrom the thirteenth century\nAnd every one of them words rang true\nAnd glowed like burning coal\nPouring off of every page\nLike it was written in my soul\nFrom me to you\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 6]\nI lived with them on Montague Street\nIn a basement down the stairs\nThere was music in the cafes at night\nAnd revolution in the air\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\nAnd something inside of him died\nShe had to sell everything she owned\nAnd froze up inside\nAnd when it finally, the bottom fell out\nI became withdrawn\nThe only thing I knew how to do\nWas to keep on keeping on\nLike a bird that flew\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 7]\nSo now I'm going back again\nI got to get to her somehow\nAll the people we used to know\nThey're an illusion to me now\nSome are mathematicians\nSome are carpenters' wives\nDon't know how it all got started\nI don't know what they're doing with their lives\nBut me, I'm still on the road\nA-heading for another joint\nWe always did feel the same\nWe just saw it from a different point\nOf view\nTangled up in blue",

Do you think that it could?\nI think you will find, when your death takes its toll\nAll the money you made will never buy back your soul\n\n[Verse 8]\nAnd I hope that you die and your death will come soon\nI will follow your casket by the pale afternoon\nAnd I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed\nAnd I'll stand over your grave 'til I'm sure that you're dead",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThe pale moon rose in its glory\nOut o'er the Western town\nShe told a sad, sad story\nOf the great ship that went down\n\n[Verse 2]\nT'was the fourteenth day of April\nOver the waves she rode\nSailing into tomorrow\nTo a gilded age foretold\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe night was black with starlight\nThe seas were sharp and clear\nMoving through the shadows\nThe promised hour was near\n\n[Verse 4]\nLights were holding steady\nGliding over the foam\nAll the lords and ladies\nHeading for their eternal home\n\n[Verse 5]\nThe chandeliers were swaying\nFrom the balustrades above\nThe orchestra was playing\nSongs of faded love\n\n[Verse 6]\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nAs the ballroom dancers twirled\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the underworld\n\n[Verse 7]\nLeo took his sketchbook\nHe was often so inclined\nHe closed his eyes and painted\nThe scenery in his mind\n\n[Verse 8]\nCupid struck his bosom\nAnd broke it with a snap\nThe closest woman to him\nHe fell into her lap\n\n[Verse 9]\nHe heard a loud commotion\nSomething sounded wrong\nHis inner spirit was saying\nThat he couldn't stand here long\n\n[Verse 10]\nHe staggered to the quarterdeck\nNo time now to sleep\nWater on the quarterdeck\nAlready three foot deep\n\n[Verse 11]\nSmokestack was leaning sideways\nHeavy feet began to pound\nHe walked into the whirlwind\nSky splitting all around\n\n[Verse 12]\nThe ship was going under\nThe universe had opened wide\nThe roll was called up yonder\nThe angels turned aside\n\n[Verse 13]\nLights down in the hallway\nFlickering dim and dull\nDead bodies already floating\nIn the double bottom hull\n\n[Verse 14]\nThe engines then exploded\nPropellers they failed to start\nThe boilers overloaded\nThe ship's bow split apart\n\n[Verse 15]\nPassengers were flying\nBackward, forward, far and fast\nThey mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled\nEach one more weary than the last\n\n[Verse 16]\nThe veil was torn asunder\n'Tween the hours of twelve and one\nNo change, no sudden wonder\nCould undo what had been done\n\n[Verse 17]\nThe watchman lay there dreaming\nAt forty-five degrees\nHe dreamed that the Titanic was sinking\nDropping to her knees\n\n[Verse 18]\nWellington he was sleeping\nHis bed began to slide\nHis valiant heart was beating\nHe pushed the tables aside\n\n[Verse 19]\nGlass of shattered crystal\nLay scattered roundabout\nHe strapped on both his pistols\nHow long could he hold out?\n\n[Verse 20]\nHis men and his companions\nWere nowhere to be seen\nIn silence there he waited for\nTime and space to intervene\n\n[Verse 21]\nThe passageway was narrow\nThere was blackness in the air\nHe saw every kind of sorrow\nHeard voices everywhere\n\n[Verse 22]\nAlarm-bells were ringing\nTo hold back the swelling tide\nFriends and lovers clinging\nTo each other side by side\n\n[Verse 23]\nMothers and their daughters\nDescending down the stairs\nJumped into the icy waters\nLove and pity sent their prayers\n\n[Verse 24]\nThe rich man, Mister Astor\nKissed his darling wife\nHe had no way of knowing\nBe the last trip of his life\n\n[Verse 25]\nCalvin, Blake, and Wilson\nGambled in the dark\nNot one of them would ever live to\nTell the tale or disembark\n\n[Verse 26]\nBrother rose up 'gainst brother\nIn every circumstance\nThey fought and slaughtered each other\nIn a deadly dance\n\n[Verse 27]\nThey lowered down the lifeboats\nFrom the sinking wreck\nThere were traitors, there were turncoats\nBroken backs and broken necks\n\n[Verse 28]\nThe bishop left his cabin\nTo help all those in need\nTurned his eyes up to the heavens\nSaid, \"The poor are yours to feed\"\n\n[Verse 29]\nDavey the brothel-keeper\nCame out dismissed his girls\nSaw the water getting deeper\nSaw the changing of his world\n\n[Verse 30]\nJim Backus smiled\nHe never learned to swim\nSaw the little crippled child\nAnd he gave his seat to him\n\n[Verse 31]\nHe saw the starlight shining\nStreaming from the East\nDeath was on the rampage\nBut his heart was now at peace\n\n[Verse 32]\nThey battened down the hatches\nBut the hatches wouldn't hold\nThey drowned upon the staircase\nOf brass and polished gold\n\n[Verse 33]\nLeo said to Cleo\nI think I'm going mad\nBut he'd lost his mind already\nWhatever mind he had\n\n[Verse 34]\nHe tried to block the doorway\nTo save all those from harm\nBlood from an open wound\nPouring down his arm\n\n[Verse 35]\nPetals fell from flowers\nTell all of them were gone\nIn the long and dreadful hours\nThe wizard's curse played on\n\n[Verse 36]\nThe host was pouring brandy\nHe was going down slow\nHe stayed right to the end and he\nWas the last to go\n\n[Verse 37]\nThere were many, many others\nNameless here forever more\nThey never sailed the ocean\nOr left their homes before\n\n[Verse 38]\nThe watchman, he lay dreaming\nThe damage had been done\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nAnd he tried to tell someone\n\n[Verse 39]\nThe captain, barely breathing\nKneeling at the wheel\nAbove him and beneath him\nFifty thousand tons of steel\n\n[Verse 40]\nHe looked over at his compass\nAnd he gazed into its face\nNeedle pointing downward\nHe knew he lost the race\n\n[Verse 41]\nIn the dark illumination\nHe remembered bygone years\nHe read the Book of Revelation\nAnd he filled his cup with tears\n\n[Verse 42]\nWhen the Reaper's task had ended\nSixteen hundred had gone to rest\nThe good, the bad, the rich, the poor\nThe loveliest and the best\n\n[Verse 43]\nThey waited at the landing\nAnd they tried to understand\nBut there is no understanding\nFor the judgment of God's hand\n\n[Verse 44]\nThe news came over the wires\nAnd struck with deadly force\nThe love had lost its fires\nAll things had run their course\n\n[Verse 45]\nThe watchman he lay dreaming\nOf all the things that can be\nHe dreamed the Titanic was sinking\nInto the deep blue sea",

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nMcKinley hollered, McKinley squalled\nDoctor said, \"McKinley, death is on the wall\n‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess\"\n‪I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬\n‪I heard it on the wireless radio ‬\n‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West\n‪I’m searching for love, for inspiration ‬\n‪On that pirate radio station\n‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬\n‪Radio signal, clear as can be\n‪I'm so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬\n‪Down on the flatlands, way down in Key West\n\n[Chorus 1]\n‪Key West is the place to be ‬\n‪If you're looking for immortality ‬\n‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬\n‪Key West is fine and fair\n‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there\n‪Key West is on the horizon line\n\n[Verse 2]\n‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track\n‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac\n‪Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬\n‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬\n‪But I'm sticking with you through and through ‬\n‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West\n‪I got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬\n‪Got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬\n‪Such is life, such is happiness\n‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here\n‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear\n‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬\n\n[Chorus 2]\n‪Key West is the place to go\n‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬\n‪Beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand\n‪Key West is the gateway key ‬\n‪To innocence and purity ‬\n‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land\n\n[Verse 3]\n‪I've never lived in the land of Oz ‬\n‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬\n‪It’s hot down here, and you can't be overdressed\n‪Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬\n‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't\n‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West ‬\n‪Well, the Fishtail Palms, and the orchid trees\n‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease\n‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬\n‪On Amelia Street, Bayview Park ‬\n‪Walking in the shadows after dark ‬\n‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬\n‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals\n‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬\n‪People tell me that I'm truly blessed ‬\nBougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring\nWinter here is an unknown thing\nDown in the flat lands, way down in Key West\n\n[Chorus 3]\nKey West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun\nYou stay to the left, and then you lean to the right\nFeel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind\nKey West, Key West is the land of light\n\n[Verse 4]\nWherever I travel, wherever I roam\nI'm not that far from the convent home\nI do what I think is right, what I think is best\nMystery Street off of Mallory Square\nTruman had his White House there\nEast bound, West bound, way down in Key West\nTwelve years old, they put me in a suit\nForced me to marry a prostitute\nThere were gold fringes on her wedding dress\nThat's my story, but not where it ends\nShe's still cute, and we're still friends\nDown on the bottom, way down in Key West\nI play both sides against the middle\nTrying to pick up that pirate radio signal\nI heard the news, I heard your last request\nFly around, my pretty little Miss\nI don't love nobody, give me a kiss\nDown on the bottom, way down in Key West\n\n[Chorus 4]\nKey West is the place to be\nIf you're looking for immortality\nKey West is paradise divine\nKey West is fine and fair\nIf you lost your mind, you'll find it there\nKey West is on the horizon line",
