They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one

Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes

I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns

Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out

Before you're lost between the notes

Just as you dance, dance, dance

You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back

At ease
Eating well

No paranoia
Careful to all animals

Hole in wall

Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders

Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows

Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society
Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva

Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

And either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard

Who's got the loneliest feeling

And either way he turns, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
