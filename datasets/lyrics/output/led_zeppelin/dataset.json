Oh\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one, and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven"
