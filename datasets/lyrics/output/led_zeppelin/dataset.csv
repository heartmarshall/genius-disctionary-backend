And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word, she can get what she came for
Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, oh-oh

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all, yeah
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven"

(Two, three, four)

Ah
Ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde and sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah
Ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an achin' in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun begin to awake (Watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose and it's startin' to flow
I think I might be sinkin'
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there
Where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings, ""La la la la""
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standin' on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Tellin' myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems (Mm, ah)

Ah, ah, ah, ah"

Whose sounds caress my ear

And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face

But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though ""Our health"" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now

I tell you no lie

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum and the Evil One crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think, ""We gots to part""
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby

I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!

And walked the night alone

The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all

I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black,
ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light

To bring the balance back
Bring it back

Sending off a glancing kiss to those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss, the devil's in his hole

Oh, to touch the dream, hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north, at last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell in pieces on the ground

Oh, to laugh aloud, dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To guide us from the curving path that turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring in celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat as proud the head with heavy feet, yeah

Will our love go on and on and on and on and on and on?

Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue eyed Merle

What you're missing, messin' 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

Baby, how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

Ooh yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah"
