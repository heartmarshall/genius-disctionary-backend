    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nYou never give me your money\nYou only give me your funny paper\nAnd in the middle of negotiations\nYou break down\n\n[Verse 2]\nI never give you my number\nI only give you my situation\nAnd in the middle of investigation\nI break down\n\n[Verse 3]\nOut of college, money spent\nSee no future, pay no rent\nAll the money's gone, nowhere to go\nAny jobber got the sack\nMonday morning, turning back\nYellow lorry slow, nowhere to go\nBut oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go\nOh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go\nNowhere to go\n\n[Interlude]\nAhhh\nAhhh\nAhhh\nAhhh\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nOne sweet dream\nPick up the bags, get in the limousine\nSoon, we'll be away from here\nStep on the gas and wipe that tear away\nOne sweet dream came true today\nCame true today\nCame true today\nYes, it did\n\n[Outro]\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven\nAll good children go to Heaven",
