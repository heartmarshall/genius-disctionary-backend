And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication

It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin, or is that war you're waging?
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication

Space may be the final frontier, but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off
Station to Station
?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication

Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Destruction leads to a very rough road, but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication

Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
Firstborn unicorn
Hardcore soft porn

Dream of Californication

Did you meet your fortune teller?
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her

Pickin' up, but not too strong for you
Take a piece and pass it on

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

Fly on my wind

Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

Adam Ant and Robert Plant, the banter of a sycophant
Enlisted by Ulysses Grant to record at the Record Plant

And if you want to be a Mod, you'll have to meet me at the quad

Talk about the lifе and death of every penny analogue
The seventies were such a win, singing the Led Zeppelin
Lizzy looking mighty Thin, the Thomson's had another Twin
My daughter won the lottery, the numbers never thought of me
Ramones had a lobotomy, so spin me like your pottery

A funky feast of Sandinista, Neon mono Mona Lisa
Judas Priest the sweet barista, mother load was named Teresa

Smoked banana in your hookah, now I know the brand is RVCA

Van Morrison, the Astral Man, a festival they have in Cannes

MC5 kick out the jam, a poncho full of contraband
Dairy Queen was on the scene, the EveryKid teen magazine
The Motorhead and Mr. Clean, my piston needed Valvoline

Well, and I can't get off
With no one else but you
You turn me on, too
Well, and I can't get up (Ooh)
For no one else but you

Creem Magazine, a Love Supreme, the ballad of a Billie Jean
And now we know the Status Quo, but God will never Save the Queen
Dave Mushegain Copenhagen, cowboy ghost of Ronald Reagan
Dollar save was Flavor-Flavin', Cosmic rays of Carl Sagan
Hammer fist, a double kiss, unlisted number purple mist
The Chubby Checker do the twist, and everyone's a narcissist

Ready set jet but she never gets far
Listen to your skin from the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck in one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind to tell my side

Whatcha want?
Whatcha need?
Do you love?

Maybe I'm the right one, maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the Papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love, maybe you're my first

Sterile as the barrel of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin and half my age
Hotter than the wax on a saxifrage

Waiting on the wind to turn my page
Steady your sails for the butterfly flap
Whatever you do, don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman, but she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim

Deep inside the garden of Eden (Eden)

There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no, that would be treason

Booty looking too good not to be squeezin' (Squeezin')

She said, ""Get out and spread your legs""
And then she tried to cop a feel (Feel)
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said ""What's up? Now suck my dick""

Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch, so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform

Proppin' her up on the black and white (White)
Unzipped and slipped, ""Ooh, that's tight""
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam (Jam)

Pretty punk rock mama that I'm thinking of (Of)
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms, in your legs, in your pussy, I'd kill (I'd kill)
To be with you
To kiss with you
I do miss you
I love you

Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love, there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
Low-ow-ow-ow-ow, ho!

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked

Bored by the ordinary, time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
A lickety split go snap ""snap""
Girl gettin' off all in my lap

The tallest tree, the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map (Map)
Ooh, and it's nice out here

Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed

Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty-chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty-gritty
Life could be a little sweet, but life could be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred, but you only ever found a fitty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome

To get your head shrunk is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline, a perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine, I'm going to make you mine

It's understood, you wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter on your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven not a head to check

Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Sailin' for the sun, 'cause there is one that knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do, I really do
Come closer now so you can lie right by my side
I sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you gettin' over myself, yeah

Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you

Close to my skin, someone who's been, I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star falling in my yard
John says to live above hell and my will is well
Long to be with someone to tell ""I love your smell"""

I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But, now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do

Let it on, I'll cut you off when you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know that everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?

You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But, now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
(Oh)
Say it again and I'll come around, but not for the last time
(Hey) Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name (Oh)
Play it again and I'll come around, come aroundBut not for the last time

Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there

Easily, let's get caught in a wave
Easily, we won't get caught in a cage

Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go

I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back

I got a soul that cannot sleep at night
When something just ain't right, ya
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red, black or white, this is my fight
Oh, come on, courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into word
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku-Klux-Klan
I don't buy supremacy
A media chief, you menace me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up, motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear?
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

Well, I got tapes, I got CD's
I got my Public Enemy
A lily white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
I'll never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo, he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power?

Power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be (Ought to be)
It fills me up like a hollow tree (Hollow tree)
The power of equality

Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, 'cause the memory linger
Count 'em off quick, little Piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick or eat my thickness
I got a welt from the Bible belt
A-dealin' with the hand that I've been dealt
I'm sittin' in the grip of a killing fist
I'm givin' up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
I know I, I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
A change of brain for Mr. Bigot

Little brother, do you hear me?
Have a heart, oh, come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?
Whatever happened to humanity?"

Knock on wood, we'll all stay good

Up to my ass in alligators
Let's get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did, did what you said
What's the point? Yo, what's the spread?

She was wavin' that dope man up
Banged a mom ’cause I see no future
Sat her down when I poured that tea
I don't know 'cause I got big temper
Stick close to my rainbow side
Candy corn and that dancing leopard
That’s all, folks, that's all

She's the kinda girl that'll make you wanna go faster now
She's the kinda girl that'll make you steal your child
She's the kinda girl, she's in her here ever after now
There’s a cry for help and I don’t deny

I don't know, but it’s finally just one more mile
Peaches are sold and all givin' up on that Humpty style
At the Caldwell 'cross from the blacktop
She's Eurasian, met her at the Quick Stop
We danced at Tito’s Go Go

So unique and I live it up 'til that liquor store close

Mangy face with the messed up lipstick

Hanging out with that Chevron dude
Knocked her out, so I let her kiss you
Redneck fights, ah, Hercules bit you
Big box, hoppin' on detox
Fast food trash when you're livin' in the crosswalk
Catch me out like motel hoes do
Blood on fries, now that's my go-to
