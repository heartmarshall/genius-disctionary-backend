Then come get his legacy out of my house\nA cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth\nYou called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down\nI'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun\nYour daddy got robbed by Top, you Stunna and Wayne, like father, like son\nAnthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'\nThey shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, \"We already won\"\nYou tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done\nWe already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one\nIt's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot\nYou right about \"Fuck the big three,\" it's only Big D, and there's video proof\nOur sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute\nUnless you don't want to be seen with anyone that isn't Blacker than you\nWe get it, we got it\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nWe get that you like to put gin in your juice\nWe get that you think that you Bishop in \nJuice\nWhen you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?\nYour back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof\nWhy did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?\nProposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife\nI'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?\n'Cause we know the girls that you actually like\nYour darkest secrets are comin' to light\nIt's all on your face like what happened to Mike\nOh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike\nMichael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white\nTop would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites\nAnd wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light\nOh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?\nI get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice\nHead to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice\nThis shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?\nYou're dead\nYou're dead, you're dead\nThere's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean\nThey hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen\nThe picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead",

1: 2 Chainz]\nMoney on my mind, you should think the same\nJ's on, pinky ring, doggin' these hoes, I need quarantine\nIn the same league, but we don't ball the same\n(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time\nShe said she love me, I said, \"Baby girl, fall in line\"\nOkay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up\nWalked in, \"Ill nigga alert, ill nigga alert\"\nYou need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo\nJust bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note\nFrom the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off\nAnd my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off\nThis that sauce, this that dressing\nGivenchy, nigga, God bless you\nIf havin' a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nGot everything, I got everything\nI

paid a lot, you get paid a bit\nAnd my latest shit is like a greatest hits\nGoddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side\nY'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all\nIt's no different over on this side\nGoddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?\n'Cause myself just told myself:\n\"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help\"\nCashing checks and I'm bigging up my chest\nY'all keep talking 'bout who next, but I'm about as big as it gets\nI swear y'all just wasting y'all breath\nI'm the light-skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever\nIt's not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet\nLook, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle\nI was made for all of this shit\nAnd I'm on the road box office sales\nI'm getting paid for all of this shit\nAsk you to please excuse my table manners\nI was making room for the table dancers\n'Cause if we judging off your advances\nThen I just got paid like eight advances, goddamn\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nGot

hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle\nBut I still take my time (Time)\nMan, I guess I'm just old fashioned\nWearing retro sh—, that's old fashion\nNigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption\nI paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit\nKeep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets\nI plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine\nLeave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip\nMy new girl is on Glee and shit\nProbably making more money than me and shit\nI swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one\nI got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one\nLike I got trust issues\nI'm sorry for the people I've pushed out\nI'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom\nAnd still gotta pull out\nBut that's just me and I ain't perfect\nI ain't a saint but I am worth it\nIf it's one thing, I am worth it\nNiggas still hating but it ain't working\nLil' bitch...\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nOh me, oh me, oh my\nI think I done fucked too many women from the 305\n'Fore the end of this year\nI'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times\nSmoking on that kush all in our section\nLike it's legalized\nGirl, you can't always have your way\nSometimes it be like that\nThey don't really fuck with you like that\nThey ain't never did me like that\nI just took my time, you got the shine\nI let you eat like that\nI been taught to never loan somebody\nWhat you need right back\nAnd I need that shit right back\n(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka\nNiggas been stressed than a muhfucka\nNiggas getting nervous\nClutching they chests like a muhfucka\nDamn that's a motherfucker\nTell the truth, I don't listen to you\n'Cause I don't like being lied to\nAnd that ship won't sail\nAnd that wind won't guide you\nDaddy was in jail, we was talking through the window\nLike a motherfucking drive-thru\nThat was back then, man\nNow my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do",

Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\n[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n\n[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\n[Outro: Baka Not Nice]\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here, eh?\nY'all need to know yourself",
