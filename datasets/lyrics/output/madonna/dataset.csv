Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, help me

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name

Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

Just like a prayer, I'll take you there
It's like a dream to me (Mm, mm-mm)
Just like a prayer, I'll take you there (I'll take you there)

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest
Then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world

'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test

Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

And as for fortune and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days

There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do
Is look at me to know

Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
It's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

American life (American life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American life)

I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Fuck it

Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it
Ah, fuck it

I'm drinking a soy latte, I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper and I'm feeling super-duper
Yo, they tell me I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard of five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just livin' out the American Dream
And I just realized that nothin' is what it seems

Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned
'Til then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

Who's got custody?
Lawyers, suck it up
Didn't have a pre-nup

I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door

I've sailed a thousand ships

You're the one for me, baby, this I know

'Cause it's true love

And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried, oh, so many times
Those teardrops, they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend
So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember, dear
Those words whispered in your ear, I said

True love

Someone said that romance was dead
And I believed it instead of remembering
What my mama told me
Let my father mold me
Then you tried to hold me
You remind me what they said
This feeling inside
I can't explain
But my love is alive
And I'm never gonna hide it again

Never gonna have to pretend
Deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper
Never gonna hide it again
Sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and sweeter
Never gonna have to pretend
You've got to just let your body move to the music
You've got to just let your body go with the flow
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love
I can't keep from falling in love with you
You know there's nothing better that I'd like to do"

Cupid, please take your aim at me

You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love

You've been through a lot
I'll tell you stories sometimes, y'know?

Seemed like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the Lower East Side
I threw my tag around, let B-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became the news

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

(Talk to 'em, talk to 'em)
I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I knew I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take you there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (Music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (What you did?)
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Uh) (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door (What?)
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers (murdered, murdered, murdered)
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowin'
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl, then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule, I'm too big to lose
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just your humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson, I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
Any trapper (trapper), any rapper (rapper)
Any politician, beautician, or musician
Anybody, saw many bodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, either that or jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless like a renegade (Try to tell 'em)
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said
I came, I saw, I conquered
I was constant as the Northern Star
I had a fire burning in my heart (Yeah)
I never gave up fighting in the dark (Let's go)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I came, I saw, I conquered

It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

The room is spinning (Spinning)
It must be the Tanqueray
I'm about to go astray
My inhibition's gone away
I feel like sinning (Sinning)
You got me in the zone
DJ, play my favorite song
Turn me on

I got that burnin' hot desire
And no one can put out my fire
It's coming right down through the wire
Here it comes
When I hear them 808 drums
It's got me singing

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

I know, I know, I know I shouldn't act this way
I know, I know, I know good girls don't misbehave
Misbehave
But I'm a bad girl anyway, hey
Forgive me

Hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like, hey-ey-ey-ey-ey-ey
Like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild

Girls, they just wanna have some fun
Get fired up like a smokin' gun
On the floor, 'til the daylight comes
Girls, they just wanna have some fun

I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild
I'm like a girl gone wild, a good girl gone wild"

Tell me love isn't true

Tell me everything I'm not

Tell the leaves not to turn

Too much for a man to take
Everything's bound to break
Sooner or later, sooner or later
You're all that I can trust
Facing the darkest days
Everyone ran away
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I know you're scared tonight
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
I'll never leave your side

When it all falls, when it all falls down
I'll be your fire when the lights go out
When there's no one, no one else around
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover
Let's just hold on to each other
When it all falls, when it all falls down
We'll be two souls in a ghost town

Tell me how we got this far
Every man for himself
Everything's gone to hell
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on
This world has turned to dust
All we've got left is love
Might as well start with us
Singing a new song, something to build on

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold
In this mad, mad, in this mad, mad world

It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing left for me to keep 'round
I'm a force and I won't tame, babe
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me crazy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão louca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the wall
Played the hand you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name) Mmm

But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish

The more that I wait, the more time that I waste

I haven't got much time to waste, it's time to make my way
I'm not afraid of what I'll face, but I'm afraid to stay
I'm going down my own road and I can make it alone
I'll work and I'll fight 'til I find a place of my own

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh, baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to jump

We learned our lesson from the start, my sisters and me
The only thing you can depend on is your family
Life's gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
It sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump
Don't ever look back, oh, baby
Yes, I'm ready to jump, just take my hands
Get ready to, are you ready?

There's only so much you can learn in one place
The more that you wait, the more time that you waste

I'll work and I'll fight 'til I find a place of my own

I can make it alone
I can make it alone (My sisters and me, my sisters and me)
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
I can make it alone
