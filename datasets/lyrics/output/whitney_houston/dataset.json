Is she sick? And how sick is she?\n\nHouston: I'm not sick, Diane. I am not sick. Let's get that straight. I'm not sick. Okay? I've always been a thin girl. I'm not going to be fat, ever. Let's get that straight. Whitney is not going to be fat, ever. Okay?\n\nSawyer: The Michael Jackson VH-1 appearance. I'm going to show you the picture.\n\nHouston: Well, that's a bad shot.\n\nSawyer: Well, it may be a bad shot, but this is real. I mean, the, the bones. That's real.\n\nHouston: Yeah, my bones, yeah. I'm, I'm 5'7\" and thin. I can understand what you mean.\n\nSawyer: But that's not just thin.\n\nHouston: No? What is it, Diane, tell me. Do you know?\n\nSawyer: It's scary thin.\n\nHouston: I can believe what you, what you feel. I can believe that. But do you really know? Do you really know?\n\nSawyer: No, you know.\n\nHouston: Thank you.\n\nSawyer: Anorexia?\n\nHouston: No way.\n\nSawyer: They've written it.\n\nHouston: No way.\n\nSawyer: Bulimia.\n\nHouston: No way.\n\nSawyer: That it's because of drugs.\n\nHouston: No. Mm mm. Now, I'll grant you, I partied. But there were times when I know I was going through a lot of emotional stress and my eating habits were awful.\n\nSawyer: Whitney dying, crack rehab fails.\n\nHouston: First of all, let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is whack.\n\nSawyer:Could you see the reaction on everybody's faces when you sang?\n\nHouston: You know what I used to do, Diane? I would close my eyes like this, and I'd sing. I was so afraid when I'd sing. Then when I would open my eyes, the people would be what we call Holy Ghost fired out. They would be in such, spirit of praise, I think I knew then that it was an infectious thing that God had given me.\n\nHouston: I'll never forget. I sang \"Home,\" the song \"Home.\"\n\n'It Wasn't Always About the Drug'\n\nHouston: No. It wasn't always about the drug. I would stay in my room for days, for days at times, just trying to get it together, to know what my next phase was going to be.\n\nSawyer: In the mid-'90s, you said \"I feel old.\"\nHouston: Yeah, like I've been through a world, a lifetime of stuff.\n\nSawyer: And that it just wasn't any fun anymore.\nHouston: Mm mm. No. I enjoy what I do. I love to sing, but it's just not fun anymore.\n\nSawyer: Because?\n\nHouston: People are different in the industry. It's about the money. It's about, get it fast.\n\nSawyer: Do you think you're not tough enough for this business?\n\nHouston: Oh, I'm tough enough.\n\nSawyer: That was a quick answer.\n\nHouston: I mean, I've lasted this long. You've got to be tough.\n\nSawyer: I want to ask you about the cancellations.\n\nHouston: Did they tell you how many? Do you know how many? Look at my record, see the concerts I've done, and see how many I've canceled in the 17 years of my career, and add it up.\n\nSawyer: But when you read the articles and people talk as if you're just impossible, 'cause you may show, you may not show.\n\nHouston: Not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.\n\nSawyer: But there's some high profile things you didn't show for.\n\nHouston: True.\n\nWhitney Houston: On Not Showing Up to Clive Davis Tribute\n\nHouston: I cried. I cried. They just all of a sudden just say one day he's not there. He's gone. That hurt, a lot.\n\nSawyer: But not showing up for Clive.\nHouston: Oh, yeah, that was between him and I. We won't discuss it.\n\nSawyer: Okay, the Academy Awards.\nHouston: Okay. I was fired from the gig. I didn't mind. I really didn't want to do it anyway. But I'm, I was past that, I'm past that, and it's over now.\n\nSawyer: Why were you fired?\nHouston: Because I was not getting along with the guy that was directing the whole thing. Who I've known since I was a kid.\n\nSawyer: I think you said laryngitis at the time. I don't think that's what you said. ... And that's all there was?\nHouston: That I can remember.\n\nSawyer: People were saying that sometimes you just didn't, you didn't seem there.\n\nHouston: Really?\n\nSawyer: Yeah.\n\nHouston: Probably, that probably was it.\n\nEmotional Turmoil and a Physical Reaction to Stress\n\nHouston: I'm the kind of person, if, if I have a day that is nerve-wracking, or my week has been bad or something's going down, I won't eat. Some people eat, I don't eat. And it shows in my physical frame.\n\nSawyer: Can I ask how much you weigh now?\n\nHouston: Sure.\n\nSawyer: How much do you weigh now?\n\nHouston: I ain't telling you.\n\nSawyer: I think I got just sucker-punched. Do you work at it now? To keep your weight up?\n\nHouston: No. You know what?\n\nSawyer: Yeah, but if people are going to be looking, and people are going to be pointing.\n\nHouston: But they always have. From the moment I stepped out there. They always have.\n\nSawyer: And looking back, the do you apologize, do you want them to . . .\n\nHouston: Yeah, there are things I apologize for. But the things I apologize for, like my concert dates, those are things I apologize for, because the people really matter to me. They matter to me. And I know they came out to see me. And I apologize for that. I'll make it up to you.\n\n'The Bodyguard' and Bobby Brown\n\nSawyer: You said you were scared to death on \"The Bodyguard.\"\n\nHouston: Scared to death. Terribly frightened. I mean, Kevin Costner. I said, why me? He said, because you're the only one that can sing.\n\nHouston: I'd wake up in the morning and I'd go, \"I can't do this. This is too much for me. Bobby, I'm going to quit today, okay, I'm gonna quit.\" He said, \"No way are you going to do that. If you quit now, you're going to blame me for the rest of my life. You're going to do this movie and you're going to do it well. You can't quit now. You can't turn back.\"\n\nHouston: We did it. You just never pictured Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston together. Who did? Love is where you find it. It's where you find it, and I found it in him, and he found it in me.\n\nHouston: He was sexy, smooth, a gentleman, and a nice guy, contrary to popular belief. A very nice guy. Treated me like a lady. We're, we're opposites in so many ways, but we're so much alike.\n\nSawyer: How are you alike?\n\nHouston: He's family oriented, I am. And they didn't give us six minutes to last. We've gone 10 years.\n\nSawyer: On the way down here, a flight attendant came up to me and said: \"I'd just like to ask her why she stays with him. Why doesn't she just leave him?\"\n\nHouston: Well, I'd like to ask her why she stays with her man. I'd like to know how her utopia is, then we can talk.\n\nSawyer: Has he ever hit you?\nHouston: No, he's never hit me, no. I've hit him, in anger.\n\nHouston: He was catatonic. You know, it took him to, like, his spirit was dead, you know.\n\nBrown: Every now and then, you know, I smoke a joint. Every now and then, you know. It's not an everyday thing. It's maybe every other day. But it's not an everyday thing. But it, it, it keeps, it keeps, it keeps me calm.\n\nSawyer: What about other drugs?\nBrown: No. No. I never have. Never have and never will. That's, that's another thing that used to get me so mad. I heard about . . .\nSawyer: Yeah, they said you tested for cocaine.\nBrown: But I tested, I tested for, I tested for a, a substance like cocaine, which can be anything. It could be an aspirin. It could be a valium. It could be anything. But it was not cocaine in my system. And this is what I know.\n\nHouston: Hey, baby.\n\nBrown: It has been 10 years since we've been married, right? They didn't think we was going to make it.\n\nHouston: I've learned so much from him as an artist.\nSawyer: What have you learned?\nHouston: How to move, to be more fluid.\n\nSawyer: Free.\n\nHouston: Free. You know what I mean? Don't be so constrained. Nothing's perfect. Nothing's perfect.\n\nSawyer: And this is forever?\n\nHouston: That's what I said. That's what I said. Didn't you?\n\nSex, Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll\n\nHouston: My business is sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll. You know? I mean, my friends, we have a good time. But as you get older, you get wiser. You know? You stop a lot of the kid stuff. I had no time to grow up, had no time to party. I didn't even date in my, date in my 20s. It was rough. It was rough. I think I kind of reverted back as I got older. And I said, well I'm just gonna party, you know? It was kind of a rebel in me, you know?\n\nSawyer: Did you think how dangerous it was?\n\nHouston: No. I wasn't, I wasn't like shooting heroin or anything.\n\nSawyer: This says $730,000 drug habit. This is a headline.\n\nHouston: Come on, 730? I wish. No. I wish that was making that money off of me, you could share it with me. No, no way. I want to see the receipts. From the drug dealer that I bought $730,000 worth of drugs from. I want to see the receipts.\n\nSawyer: Is it alcohol? Is it marijuana? Is it cocaine? Is it pills?\n\nHouston: It has been. At times.\n\nSawyer: All?\n\nHouston: At times.\n\nSawyer: If you had to name the devil for you, the biggest devil among them?\n\nHouston: That would be me. It's my deciding, it's my heart, it's what I want. And what I don't want. Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to do. It's my decision. So the biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy. And that's how I have to deal with it.\n\nSawyer: Do you think of yourself as an addict?\n\nHouston: I am addicted to a few things.\n\nSawyer: Like?\n\nHouston: Making love. I don't like to think of myself addicted. I like to think of, I had a bad habit, which can be broken.\n\nWhitney Houston's Mother Intervenes\n\nHouston: And she gets in my door, \"There's some people I want you to meet.\" I said, \"Mommy, you've raised me with the love, and with God. Now, if I can't make it with you and with the love of God, I'm not putting my, my, my life in someone else's hands. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. And nobody else, I don't care where they're from, what counsel service, or whatever they're from, if you did this to me, I will go and leave the country, take  Krissy with me, and we'll just go. And I was very serious. And she said, \"Everybody leave, please. Wait a minute. Because she's serious.\"\n\nWhitney Houston: 'I Partied'\n\nSawyer: But tell me about you that night. First of all, had you been partying? Is that part of it?\n\nHouston: Was I, I can't say it was like an everyday kind of thing, yeah. I hung out with some friends and I partied.\n\nSawyer: Did it seem to ease the pressure? Did it quiet the voice in your head?\n\nHouston: Seemed.\n\nSawyer: Seemed?\n\nHouston: Seemed, yes.\n\nPhotos taken that night showed Houston, skin and bones, even though the tape of the show that was broadcast on TV showed her fattened up. Pounds had been added to her frame.\n\nSawyer: Did you see that they took electronic devices and changed it for the air?\n\nHouston: They did it for me and a few other people.\n\nSawyer: Other people, too? Other people, yes? Because that sparked that whole thing, when the headlines were saying \"Whitney is dying.\"\n\nHouston: No. \"Whitney was dead.\"\n\nSawyer: How scared did you get?\n\nHouston: Scared. When they said that I had died, I did, I changed my mind. I changed my mind. Yep. Because I didn't want to look like the rest of them. I didn't want to be like them. It frightened me. I don't ever want to be in the realm of, where I'm caught in a mold and I can't get out. Never. That's over. I'm beyond it.\n\nSawyer: Do you think you came close?\n\nSawyer: I think as close as anybody, I think, can get. I know folks who have come closer. But that's as close as I want to be. That's as close as I think it gets.\n\nSawyer: And how sure are you that those bad days you talked about are behind you?\n\nSawyer: I know that I'm on the right path, because I'm back home where I started, in here. I can't tell you it's all going to be perfect, Diane, and I can't say ...\n\nSawyer: Yeah, because every, everybody says it's day by day, day by day.\n\nHouston: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSawyer: But now do you say, not at all, or do you say, I can . . .\n\nHouston: Well, I'm not going to tell you that. I can tell you that I am not self- destructive. I'm not a person who wants to die. I'm a person who has life, who wants to live. And I always have. And I wouldn't mistake it for anything else other than that.\n\nSawyer: Are you strong enough to do that now?\n\nHouston: I think so.\n\nSawyer: And not let it get you?\n\nHouston: Mm hmm. Yes, I am.\n\nSawyer: 'Cause most people . . .\n\nHouston: I pray every day that I am. I'm not the strongest every day, but I'm not the weakest, either. And I won't break. And I won't break.\n\nSawyer: Is today a good day?\n\nHouston: Today's a great day. It's a blessed day.\n\nSawyer: No temptations today?\n\nHouston: I have a few temptations, but it's not about drugs, it's about kicking ass, but, you know.\n\nSawyer: Mine?\n\nHouston: No. This is a blessing.\n\nABC News asked how hard would it be for her to change her life when drug use is so close in those she loves -- not only her husband but her two brothers have each been caught with cocaine and marijuana. Even her cousin Dionne Warwick was stopped at an airport with marijuana.\n\nSawyer: Your cousin\n\nHouston: Jesus.\n\nSawyer: Your cousin did.\n\nHouston: Very isolated incidents. One had nothing to do with the other.\n\nHouston: I talk to people who have been through rehab, and a lot of people that come through it, come through it with God. They tell you in a rehab that 90 percent of you are gonna return. That's not nice. That's not nice. So what I did is I looked in my soul to see what was missing.\n\nSawyer: So for the people out there who say we want to help, we want to help build a barrier between her and drugs, what do you want them to pray for?\n\nWhitney Houston: 'Leave the Drugs Alone'\n\nHouston: Don't pray about the drugs. Leave the drugs alone.\n\nSawyer: Why? Why?\n\nHouston: Don't, don't, pray for me, as a person, for my soul, that I'm stronger. And man, I don't care what anybody else says or did or what they claimed I was, I know I'm a child of God, and I know He loves me. Jesus loves me, this I know. Yeah.\n\nLosing Friends\n\nHouston: There isn't competition. There's no competition. That's my husband. If you want to be my friend, let's remain friends. If you can't handle that, sorry.\n\nHouston:  And I love ya.\n\nSawyer: Your father's filing suit against you, $100 million. Do you feel betrayed?\n\nHouston: It hurts. They'll never get $100 million out of me. I know that.\n\nSawyer: But they claim that you haven't paid them for things they did, like ...\n\nHouston: They were never hired. But I won't get into it.\n\nSawyer: Can you talk to him? What has he said to you?\n\nHouston: My father is, 81, very sick. His health is failing. Somebody is, who my father's associated with, has put fear in his heart, as if he's not my father and I'm not his daughter.\n\nSawyer: Do you still love him?\n\nHouston: Absolutely. He gave me life. Before all of this, there were years that I can't forget. The bad part about it is that it's about money, and that really sucks. That's, that hurts more than anything.\n\nSawyer: When you think it's the dad who dressed you and walked you down the aisle, what are you thinking?\n\nHouston: That moment. Can I stop, please?\n\nSawyer: Sure.\n\nHouston: Thanks. I'll be back.\n\nSawyer: Sure.\n\nMeeting Daughter Bobbi Kristina \"Krissy\" Houston\n\nSawyer: Do you like to sing?\n\nKrissy Houston: Yes.\n\nSawyer: Would you like it?\n\nKrissy Houston: Yes, and I want to be like my mommy and daddy.\n\nHouston: Early in the morning, she and I would have private time together when nobody's around. And I'll sneak up to her room, about 6:00, and I'll get in the bed with her and I'll say, okay, we gotta get up in a little while. And I'll rub her stomach, wake the stomach up, wake up your back, wake up the mind, wake up the, you know, body. And talk.\n\nKrissy Houston: You know, the perfect thing is like, on, like, a Sunday or something like that, when we like, like, sit and, you know, we get to watch TV or like, listen to gospel music or have breakfast together.\n\nSawyer: And what do you like about your mom's voice?\n\nKrissy Houston: I like her voice because it's really nice and it makes me go to sleep.\n\nSawyer: She sings you lullabies?\n\nHouston: I love you, I love you.\n\nSawyer: Ten years from now, give me the perfect life for Whitney Houston.\n\nHouston: Retired. Sitting, looking at my daughter grow up, become a great woman of God, grandchildren.\n\nSawyer: And perhaps, some measure of peace for Whitney Houston, a woman whose ethereal talent is matched only by the uncertainties of her all too human life.\n\nHouston: This is my time, now. You know, love me or leave me. But love me, 'cause I love you."

Who told you that is true?\nWhat is he telling you?\nCould it be the same things that he told me?\nHe told me that he loved me\nI heard that\nHe told me I was beautiful\nHow did you know? How did you know?\n'Cause I've played that scene before\n\nThis is a retake of my life\nI was his star for many nights\nNow, the roles have changed\nAnd you're the leading lady in his life\nLights, camera, now you're on\nJust remember you've been warned\nEnjoy it now, 'cause it won't last\nSame script, different cast\n\nWhat you're saying could be true\nBut how can I take advice from you?\nI'm not hating\nBut I wish the one before me would have warned me too, babe\nOoh, don't say no more (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)\nUncover your ears, girl\nI'm not listening (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)\nBut I know you hear me\nMaybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me\n\nThis is a retake of my life (This is a retake of my life)\nI was his star for many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)\nNow, the roles have changed\nAnd you're the leading lady in his life\nLights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)\nJust remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)\nEnjoy it now, 'cause it won't last\nSame script, different cast\n\nIt's your fault you didn't love him enough\nThat's the problem, I loved him too much\nAnd when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you\nOh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong\nNo, you won't\nSo go away, leave us the hell alone, 'cause he loves me\nHe'll hurt you\nHe'll stay with me\nHe'll leave you\nFor sure, for sure\n\nThis is a retake of my life (A retake of my life; Yes, it is)\nI was his star for many, many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)\nNow, the roles have changed (Now, na-na-na-na-na-now, now, the roles have changed)\nAnd I'm the leading lady in his life\nLights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)\nJust remember you've been warned (You've been warned)\nEnjoy it now, because it won't last, no\nSame script, different cast\nThis is a retake of your life\nYou were his star for many nights\nBut now, the roles have changed\nI'm the leading lady in his life\nLights (Lights), camera, now you're on\nJust remember you've been warned\nEnjoy it now, 'cause this will last\nI'm the future, you're his past\nThis is a retake of my life (The past, oh)\nI was his star for many nights (Oh, oh)\nNow, the roles have changed\nAnd you're the leading lady in his life\nLights, camera, now you're on\nJust remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)\nEnjoy it now, just you watch us now\nIt won't last, I know it will last\nThe same script, different cast\n(Oh Lord Jesus; woah)"
