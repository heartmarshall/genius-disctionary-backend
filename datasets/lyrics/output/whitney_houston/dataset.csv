Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there?
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm

Will our memories survive? One I can hold on to

Spinnin' through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feelin' down

On a love that burns hot enough to last

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe

I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all

Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love"

Love gives you the right to be free
You said, ""Be patient, just wait a little longer.""
But that's just an old fantasy

I've got to get ready
Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door

Won't they always love you?

That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away

She took your smile away
And left me with just memories, all at once

Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Though I must face it all alone

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows
All at once
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you'd come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
All at once"

Whitney Houston: Yeah.

Sawyer: Everybody watching this . . .

Houston: Yeah.

Sawyer: Is going to be staring at you, physically.

Houston: Yeah.

Sawyer: And they're going to be saying, how thin is she now?

Houston: Yeah.

Sawyer: How, how many bones can we see? Is she sick? And how sick is she?

Houston: I'm not sick, Diane. I am not sick. Let's get that straight. I'm not sick. Okay? I've always been a thin girl. I'm not going to be fat, ever. Let's get that straight. Whitney is not going to be fat, ever. Okay?

Sawyer: The Michael Jackson VH-1 appearance. I'm going to show you the picture.

Houston: Well, that's a bad shot.

Sawyer: Well, it may be a bad shot, but this is real. I mean, the, the bones. That's real.

Houston: Yeah, my bones, yeah. I'm, I'm 5'7"" and thin. I can understand what you mean.

Sawyer: But that's not just thin.

Houston: No? What is it, Diane, tell me. Do you know?

Sawyer: It's scary thin.

Houston: I can believe what you, what you feel. I can believe that. But do you really know? Do you really know?

Sawyer: No, you know.

Houston: Thank you.

Sawyer: Anorexia?

Houston: No way.

Sawyer: They've written it.

Houston: No way.

Sawyer: Bulimia.

Houston: No way.

Sawyer: That it's because of drugs.

Houston: No. Mm mm. Now, I'll grant you, I partied. But there were times when I know I was going through a lot of emotional stress and my eating habits were awful.

Sawyer: Whitney dying, crack rehab fails.

Houston: First of all, let's get one thing straight. Crack is cheap. I make too much money to ever smoke crack. Let's get that straight. Okay? We don't do crack. We don't do that. Crack is whack.

Sawyer:Could you see the reaction on everybody's faces when you sang?

Houston: You know what I used to do, Diane? I would close my eyes like this, and I'd sing. I was so afraid when I'd sing. Then when I would open my eyes, the people would be what we call Holy Ghost fired out. They would be in such, spirit of praise, I think I knew then that it was an infectious thing that God had given me.

Houston: I'll never forget. I sang ""Home,"" the song ""Home.""

'It Wasn't Always About the Drug'

Houston: No. It wasn't always about the drug. I would stay in my room for days, for days at times, just trying to get it together, to know what my next phase was going to be.

Sawyer: In the mid-'90s, you said ""I feel old.""
Houston: Yeah, like I've been through a world, a lifetime of stuff.

Sawyer: And that it just wasn't any fun anymore.
Houston: Mm mm. No. I enjoy what I do. I love to sing, but it's just not fun anymore.

Sawyer: Because?

Houston: People are different in the industry. It's about the money. It's about, get it fast.

Sawyer: Do you think you're not tough enough for this business?

Houston: Oh, I'm tough enough.

Sawyer: That was a quick answer.

Houston: I mean, I've lasted this long. You've got to be tough.

Sawyer: I want to ask you about the cancellations.

Houston: Did they tell you how many? Do you know how many? Look at my record, see the concerts I've done, and see how many I've canceled in the 17 years of my career, and add it up.

Sawyer: But when you read the articles and people talk as if you're just impossible, 'cause you may show, you may not show.

Houston: Not true. Not true. Not true. Not true.

Sawyer: But there's some high profile things you didn't show for.

Houston: True.

Whitney Houston: On Not Showing Up to Clive Davis Tribute

Houston: I cried. I cried. They just all of a sudden just say one day he's not there. He's gone. That hurt, a lot.

Sawyer: But not showing up for Clive.
Houston: Oh, yeah, that was between him and I. We won't discuss it.

Sawyer: Okay, the Academy Awards.
Houston: Okay. I was fired from the gig. I didn't mind. I really didn't want to do it anyway. But I'm, I was past that, I'm past that, and it's over now.

Sawyer: Why were you fired?
Houston: Because I was not getting along with the guy that was directing the whole thing. Who I've known since I was a kid.

Sawyer: I think you said laryngitis at the time. I don't think that's what you said. ... And that's all there was?
Houston: That I can remember.

Sawyer: People were saying that sometimes you just didn't, you didn't seem there.

Houston: Really?

Sawyer: Yeah.

Houston: Probably, that probably was it.

Emotional Turmoil and a Physical Reaction to Stress

Houston: I'm the kind of person, if, if I have a day that is nerve-wracking, or my week has been bad or something's going down, I won't eat. Some people eat, I don't eat. And it shows in my physical frame.

Sawyer: Can I ask how much you weigh now?

Houston: Sure.

Sawyer: How much do you weigh now?

Houston: I ain't telling you.

Sawyer: I think I got just sucker-punched. Do you work at it now? To keep your weight up?

Houston: No. You know what?

Sawyer: Yeah, but if people are going to be looking, and people are going to be pointing.

Houston: But they always have. From the moment I stepped out there. They always have.

Sawyer: And looking back, the do you apologize, do you want them to . . .

Houston: Yeah, there are things I apologize for. But the things I apologize for, like my concert dates, those are things I apologize for, because the people really matter to me. They matter to me. And I know they came out to see me. And I apologize for that. I'll make it up to you.

'The Bodyguard' and Bobby Brown

Sawyer: You said you were scared to death on ""The Bodyguard.""

Houston: Scared to death. Terribly frightened. I mean, Kevin Costner. I said, why me? He said, because you're the only one that can sing.

Houston: I'd wake up in the morning and I'd go, ""I can't do this. This is too much for me. Bobby, I'm going to quit today, okay, I'm gonna quit."" He said, ""No way are you going to do that. If you quit now, you're going to blame me for the rest of my life. You're going to do this movie and you're going to do it well. You can't quit now. You can't turn back.""

Houston: We did it. You just never pictured Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston together. Who did? Love is where you find it. It's where you find it, and I found it in him, and he found it in me.

Houston: He was sexy, smooth, a gentleman, and a nice guy, contrary to popular belief. A very nice guy. Treated me like a lady. We're, we're opposites in so many ways, but we're so much alike.

Sawyer: How are you alike?

Houston: He's family oriented, I am. And they didn't give us six minutes to last. We've gone 10 years.

Sawyer: On the way down here, a flight attendant came up to me and said: ""I'd just like to ask her why she stays with him. Why doesn't she just leave him?""

Houston: Well, I'd like to ask her why she stays with her man. I'd like to know how her utopia is, then we can talk.

Sawyer: Has he ever hit you?
Houston: No, he's never hit me, no. I've hit him, in anger.

Houston: He was catatonic. You know, it took him to, like, his spirit was dead, you know.

Brown: Every now and then, you know, I smoke a joint. Every now and then, you know. It's not an everyday thing. It's maybe every other day. But it's not an everyday thing. But it, it, it keeps, it keeps, it keeps me calm.

Sawyer: What about other drugs?
Brown: No. No. I never have. Never have and never will. That's, that's another thing that used to get me so mad. I heard about . . .
Sawyer: Yeah, they said you tested for cocaine.
Brown: But I tested, I tested for, I tested for a, a substance like cocaine, which can be anything. It could be an aspirin. It could be a valium. It could be anything. But it was not cocaine in my system. And this is what I know.

Houston: Hey, baby.

Brown: It has been 10 years since we've been married, right? They didn't think we was going to make it.

Houston: I've learned so much from him as an artist.
Sawyer: What have you learned?
Houston: How to move, to be more fluid.

Sawyer: Free.

Houston: Free. You know what I mean? Don't be so constrained. Nothing's perfect. Nothing's perfect.

Sawyer: And this is forever?

Houston: That's what I said. That's what I said. Didn't you?

Sex, Drugs and Rock 'N' Roll

Houston: My business is sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll. You know? I mean, my friends, we have a good time. But as you get older, you get wiser. You know? You stop a lot of the kid stuff. I had no time to grow up, had no time to party. I didn't even date in my, date in my 20s. It was rough. It was rough. I think I kind of reverted back as I got older. And I said, well I'm just gonna party, you know? It was kind of a rebel in me, you know?

Sawyer: Did you think how dangerous it was?

Houston: No. I wasn't, I wasn't like shooting heroin or anything.

Sawyer: This says $730,000 drug habit. This is a headline.

Houston: Come on, 730? I wish. No. I wish that was making that money off of me, you could share it with me. No, no way. I want to see the receipts. From the drug dealer that I bought $730,000 worth of drugs from. I want to see the receipts.

Sawyer: Is it alcohol? Is it marijuana? Is it cocaine? Is it pills?

Houston: It has been. At times.

Sawyer: All?

Houston: At times.

Sawyer: If you had to name the devil for you, the biggest devil among them?

Houston: That would be me. It's my deciding, it's my heart, it's what I want. And what I don't want. Nobody makes me do anything I don't want to do. It's my decision. So the biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy. And that's how I have to deal with it.

Sawyer: Do you think of yourself as an addict?

Houston: I am addicted to a few things.

Sawyer: Like?

Houston: Making love. I don't like to think of myself addicted. I like to think of, I had a bad habit, which can be broken.

Whitney Houston's Mother Intervenes

Houston: And she gets in my door, ""There's some people I want you to meet."" I said, ""Mommy, you've raised me with the love, and with God. Now, if I can't make it with you and with the love of God, I'm not putting my, my, my life in someone else's hands. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. And nobody else, I don't care where they're from, what counsel service, or whatever they're from, if you did this to me, I will go and leave the country, take  Krissy with me, and we'll just go. And I was very serious. And she said, ""Everybody leave, please. Wait a minute. Because she's serious.""

Whitney Houston: 'I Partied'

Sawyer: But tell me about you that night. First of all, had you been partying? Is that part of it?

Houston: Was I, I can't say it was like an everyday kind of thing, yeah. I hung out with some friends and I partied.

Sawyer: Did it seem to ease the pressure? Did it quiet the voice in your head?

Houston: Seemed.

Sawyer: Seemed?

Houston: Seemed, yes.

Photos taken that night showed Houston, skin and bones, even though the tape of the show that was broadcast on TV showed her fattened up. Pounds had been added to her frame.

Sawyer: Did you see that they took electronic devices and changed it for the air?

Houston: They did it for me and a few other people.

Sawyer: Other people, too? Other people, yes? Because that sparked that whole thing, when the headlines were saying ""Whitney is dying.""

Houston: No. ""Whitney was dead.""

Sawyer: How scared did you get?

Houston: Scared. When they said that I had died, I did, I changed my mind. I changed my mind. Yep. Because I didn't want to look like the rest of them. I didn't want to be like them. It frightened me. I don't ever want to be in the realm of, where I'm caught in a mold and I can't get out. Never. That's over. I'm beyond it.

Sawyer: Do you think you came close?

Sawyer: I think as close as anybody, I think, can get. I know folks who have come closer. But that's as close as I want to be. That's as close as I think it gets.

Sawyer: And how sure are you that those bad days you talked about are behind you?

Sawyer: I know that I'm on the right path, because I'm back home where I started, in here. I can't tell you it's all going to be perfect, Diane, and I can't say ...

Sawyer: Yeah, because every, everybody says it's day by day, day by day.

Houston: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Sawyer: But now do you say, not at all, or do you say, I can . . .

Houston: Well, I'm not going to tell you that. I can tell you that I am not self- destructive. I'm not a person who wants to die. I'm a person who has life, who wants to live. And I always have. And I wouldn't mistake it for anything else other than that.

Sawyer: Are you strong enough to do that now?

Houston: I think so.

Sawyer: And not let it get you?

Houston: Mm hmm. Yes, I am.

Sawyer: 'Cause most people . . .

Houston: I pray every day that I am. I'm not the strongest every day, but I'm not the weakest, either. And I won't break. And I won't break.

Sawyer: Is today a good day?

Houston: Today's a great day. It's a blessed day.

Sawyer: No temptations today?

Houston: I have a few temptations, but it's not about drugs, it's about kicking ass, but, you know.

Sawyer: Mine?

Houston: No. This is a blessing.

ABC News asked how hard would it be for her to change her life when drug use is so close in those she loves -- not only her husband but her two brothers have each been caught with cocaine and marijuana. Even her cousin Dionne Warwick was stopped at an airport with marijuana.

Sawyer: Your cousin

Houston: Jesus.

Sawyer: Your cousin did.

Houston: Very isolated incidents. One had nothing to do with the other.

Houston: I talk to people who have been through rehab, and a lot of people that come through it, come through it with God. They tell you in a rehab that 90 percent of you are gonna return. That's not nice. That's not nice. So what I did is I looked in my soul to see what was missing.

Sawyer: So for the people out there who say we want to help, we want to help build a barrier between her and drugs, what do you want them to pray for?

Whitney Houston: 'Leave the Drugs Alone'

Houston: Don't pray about the drugs. Leave the drugs alone.

Sawyer: Why? Why?

Houston: Don't, don't, pray for me, as a person, for my soul, that I'm stronger. And man, I don't care what anybody else says or did or what they claimed I was, I know I'm a child of God, and I know He loves me. Jesus loves me, this I know. Yeah.

Losing Friends

Houston: There isn't competition. There's no competition. That's my husband. If you want to be my friend, let's remain friends. If you can't handle that, sorry.

Houston:  And I love ya.

Sawyer: Your father's filing suit against you, $100 million. Do you feel betrayed?

Houston: It hurts. They'll never get $100 million out of me. I know that.

Sawyer: But they claim that you haven't paid them for things they did, like ...

Houston: They were never hired. But I won't get into it.

Sawyer: Can you talk to him? What has he said to you?

Houston: My father is, 81, very sick. His health is failing. Somebody is, who my father's associated with, has put fear in his heart, as if he's not my father and I'm not his daughter.

Sawyer: Do you still love him?

Houston: Absolutely. He gave me life. Before all of this, there were years that I can't forget. The bad part about it is that it's about money, and that really sucks. That's, that hurts more than anything.

Sawyer: When you think it's the dad who dressed you and walked you down the aisle, what are you thinking?

Houston: That moment. Can I stop, please?

Sawyer: Sure.

Houston: Thanks. I'll be back.

Sawyer: Sure.

Meeting Daughter Bobbi Kristina ""Krissy"" Houston

Sawyer: Do you like to sing?

Krissy Houston: Yes.

Sawyer: Would you like it?

Krissy Houston: Yes, and I want to be like my mommy and daddy.

Houston: Early in the morning, she and I would have private time together when nobody's around. And I'll sneak up to her room, about 6:00, and I'll get in the bed with her and I'll say, okay, we gotta get up in a little while. And I'll rub her stomach, wake the stomach up, wake up your back, wake up the mind, wake up the, you know, body. And talk.

Krissy Houston: You know, the perfect thing is like, on, like, a Sunday or something like that, when we like, like, sit and, you know, we get to watch TV or like, listen to gospel music or have breakfast together.

Sawyer: And what do you like about your mom's voice?

Krissy Houston: I like her voice because it's really nice and it makes me go to sleep.

Sawyer: She sings you lullabies?

Houston: I love you, I love you.

Sawyer: Ten years from now, give me the perfect life for Whitney Houston.

Houston: Retired. Sitting, looking at my daughter grow up, become a great woman of God, grandchildren.

Sawyer: And perhaps, some measure of peace for Whitney Houston, a woman whose ethereal talent is matched only by the uncertainties of her all too human life.

Houston: This is my time, now. You know, love me or leave me. But love me, 'cause I love you."

I, I thought I would break

I didn't know my own strength

I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home
I wish I was back there
With the things I've been knowing

Wind that makes the tall grass
Bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall
They have a meaning
Sprinkling the scene
Makes it all so clean

And maybe there's a chance
For me to go back
Now that I, I have some direction
And it sure would be nice
To be back home
Where there's love and affection

And just maybe I can convince time
To slow up
Giving me enough time in my life
To grow up
Time, please stay my friend
And let me start again

Suddenly my world is gonna change its face
But I know, I know where I'm going
I have had my mind
Spun around and around in space
Yet I've watched it growing

Oh, I know you're listening, Lord
So won't you please try not to make it hard
To know I shouldn't believe everything
Everything that I see
Tell me, should I try and stay?
Or maybe I should run away
Would it be better, better, better, better
Just to let things be?

Living here in my brand new world
It might be a fantasy
Yes, yeah, it could be
But it taught me to love
So I know that it's real, it's real, it's real to me
And I've learned that we must look
Inside our hearts to find
Yeah, we gotta find

Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea
Or maybe a carpenter building things
But who would imagine a king?
It was so clear when the wise men arrived
And the angels were singing your name
That the world would be different cause you were alive
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim

One day an angel said quietly
That soon he would bring something special to me
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring

Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh, joy, joy, joy in my soul

Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you whole
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger

Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh

He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holiday
To take our pain away

Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh

Go tell it on the mountain
Shout it from a valley
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes
Men in every nation
Join the celebration

Way down deep joy
Joy, joy, joy
I've got joy
Way down deep inside my soul joy
Unspeakable joy
Joy in my soul"

Mhm
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?

I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that? Who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
'Cause I've played that scene before

This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating
But I wish the one before me would have warned me too, babe
Ooh, don't say no more (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
Uncover your ears, girl
I'm not listening (La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me

This is a retake of my life (This is a retake of my life)
I was his star for many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
Enjoy it now, 'cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

It's your fault you didn't love him enough
That's the problem, I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changed and I'll prove you wrong
No, you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone, 'cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you
For sure, for sure

This is a retake of my life (A retake of my life; Yes, it is)
I was his star for many, many nights (Star for many, many, many, many nights)
Now, the roles have changed (Now, na-na-na-na-na-now, now, the roles have changed)
And I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on (Camera, now you're on)
Just remember you've been warned (You've been warned)
Enjoy it now, because it won't last, no
Same script, different cast
This is a retake of your life
You were his star for many nights
But now, the roles have changed
I'm the leading lady in his life
Lights (Lights), camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now, 'cause this will last
I'm the future, you're his past
This is a retake of my life (The past, oh)
I was his star for many nights (Oh, oh)
Now, the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned (Remember you've been warned)
Enjoy it now, just you watch us now
It won't last, I know it will last
The same script, different cast
(Oh Lord Jesus; woah)"

Ooh, hey, baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be than with you
Loving you
Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly coming into view

I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You, you, you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me when the morning comes
Feels good to me
My love and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Smoother then a gentle breeze
Flowing from my mind with ease
Soft as can be
Well, when you're loving me, ooh, ooh, baby

Love to be
Riding the waves of love, enchanted with your touch
It seems to me
We can sail together in and out of mystery

I wanna be living for the love of you, baby, baby
All that I'm giving, giving is for the love of you
You, you, you

Paradise, I have within
Can't feel as secure again
You're the key
And this I see, yeah, ooh
Now and then I lose my way
Using words to try and say what I feel
Oh yeah, your love is real, ooh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card that could say it better
See, time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do
Do, do

I wanna be living for the love of you
(Living for you, only for you, boy)
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
(My love for you, baby)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(I, I, I, baby)
All that I'm giving, giving is for the love of you
(For the love of you, better believe it, boy)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(Of you, of you, of you, of you, wanna be giving, giving, giving)
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
(All my love to you, to you, you)
I wanna be living for the love of you
(I wanna be living, I wanna be living)
(Nobody else but you, boy)
All that I'm giving is for the love of you

I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

Now Romeo, you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)

Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

Now Romeo, you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me, boy

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say (You better watch what you say, boy)
If you still need her
Then be on your way (Be on your way, yeah)
Don't wanna hear about Susan (I don't wanna hear)
She's got nothing on me (Nothing on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan (You better watch what you say)
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way
Don't wanna hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me (Got nothing on me)
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan, oh

I never wanna be the girly that you ""call"" one and only
You know the kind of girl
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name!
Well, anyway

My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her (Need her)
Then be on your way (Boy, don't you be on your way)
Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan

Don't wanna hear about Susan
Oh no, oh no, no, no, no
My name ain't Susan
You better get it right"
