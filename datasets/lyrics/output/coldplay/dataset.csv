Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (
Mmm, mmm
)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trustin' statistics more than I trust me

But I’m tryin' to turn K’s to M’s, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it
Just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show, or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself
But honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent 'til we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races
Success I taste it, ah, we on the verge
Of getting every single thing that we deserve

Yeah, you could be someone special
You've got fire in your eyes
I see heaven inside
You'll go further than we've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got bright in your brains
You can break through those chains
You'll go higher than we've ever gone

Just turn, just turn, just turn it on

There was snow, white snow

From the windows, they were watchin'
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And the fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armour
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

And if you love me
Won't you let me know?

Woah, woah

I don't wanna be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me
Won't you let me know?
