Lee, Beauregard and Bragg\nAnd the south wind blew hard on that ragged old flag\nOn Flanders Field in World War I\nShe got a big hole from a Bertha Gun\nShe turned blood red in World War II\nShe hung limp, and low, a time or two\nShe was in Korea, Vietnam\nShe went where she was sent\nBy her Uncle Sam\nShe waved from our ships upon the briny foam\nAnd now they've about quit waving back here at home\nIn her own good land here she's been abused\nShe's been burned, dishonored, denied and refused\nAnd the government for which she stands\nIs scandalized throughout out the land\nAnd she's gettin' thread bare, and she's wearing thin\nBut she's in good shape for the shape she's in\n'Cause she's been through the fire before\nAnd I believe she can take a whole lot more\"\nSo we raise her up every morning\nWe take her down every night\nWe don't let her touch the ground and we fold her up right\nOn second thought, I do like to brag\n'Cause I'm mighty proud of that ragged old flag",
