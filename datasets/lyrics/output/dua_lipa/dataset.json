Mmm-hmm\nWe're all terrified of heartbreak\nRun at first signs of problems\nMake it look way too easy\nWe all got too many options\nRemember when (Remember when)\nWe used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)\n\nBut I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily\nI want a love that's set on keeping me\nWhen it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off\nRemember when (Remember when) we used to do anything for love?\n\nI think that's the one, right?\nAll right, cool"

Uh\n\nI'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear\nLike what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?\nI start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain\nWicked love's creepin' up\n\nSo, baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)\nThe thought of you with someone kills me\nI'll be dancing with my heart broke\nSuch a sad disco if it ain't me\nAnd, baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)\nFind another lover, you'll see\nI'll be dancing with my heart broke\nSuch a sad disco if it ain't me\n\nI got a little devil dancing in my mind\nPlaying tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow\nI try to shake it off by looking in your eyes\nAll the voices in my head keep tryna tell me it's goodbye, uh\n\nI'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear\nLike what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?\nI start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain\nWicked love's creepin' up\n\nSo, baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)\nThe thought of you with someone kills me\nI'll be dancing with my heart broke\nSuch a sad disco if it ain't me\nAnd, baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)\nFind another lover, you'll see\nI'll be dancing with my heart broke\nSuch a sad disco if it ain't me\n\n(So, baby, don't you let go)\nI'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear (The thought of you with someone kills me)\nLike what if you left me here (I'll be dancing with my heart broke)\nLike what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
