Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I got new, I got new)

One, don't pick up the phone (Yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (Alone)
Two, don't let him in (Oh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (Again)
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em (Woah, oh)
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em (Baby, you know I count 'em)
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't

You blamed it all on the alcohol

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go

Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time

We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you

Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?

Tells me that I'm doing you wrong, if I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

How can we go back to the beginning?

You know
I'll roar like a lion
For you
You know I'll keep trying
Till the sun stops rising

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch

Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?

And no one promises always
We're not perfect together
That means we gotta part ways
Remember when
We used to do anything for love? Mmm-hmm
We're all terrified of heartbreak
Run at first signs of problems
Make it look way too easy
We all got too many options
Remember when (Remember when)
We used to do anything for love? (Anything for love)

But I'm not interested in a love that gives up so easily
I want a love that's set on keeping me
When it hurts, we don't even think to cut it off
Remember when (Remember when) we used to do anything for love?

I think that's the one, right?
All right, cool"

This connection got me feeling like I've known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So why do I think of losing you when you're right by my side? Uh

I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So, baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And, baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks on my imagination, ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna tell me it's goodbye, uh

I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears?
I start getting in my brain something I do that I can't explain
Wicked love's creepin' up

So, baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And, baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me

(So, baby, don't you let go)
I'm not really thinking clear, too good to be true and that's what I fear (The thought of you with someone kills me)
Like what if you left me here (I'll be dancing with my heart broke)
Like what if you left me here and I fill the floor with my sequin tears? (Such a sad disco if it ain't me; Tears)

So, baby, don't you let go (Ah, ah-ah)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me
And, baby, if you ever (Ah, ah-ah)
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco if it ain't me"
