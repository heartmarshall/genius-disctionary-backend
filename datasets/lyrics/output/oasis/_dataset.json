(Ah-ah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou got how many bills to pay and how many kids?\nAnd you forgot about the things that we did\nThe town where we're living has made you a man\nAnd all of your dreams are washed away in the sand\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, it's alright, it's alright\nWho are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?\nDo you still feel like me? (Do you feel like me?)\nWe sit down here and we shall see (We shall see)\nWe can talk and find common ground (Common ground)\nAnd we can just forget about feeling down (Ha-ah-ah)\nWe can just forget about life in this town (Ha-ah, ah-ah)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's funny how your dreams change as you're growing old\nYou don't wanna be no spaceman, you just want the gold\nAll the dream stealers are lying in wait\nBut if you wanna be a spaceman, it's still not too late\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, it's alright and it's alright\nWho are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?\nDo you still feel like me?
