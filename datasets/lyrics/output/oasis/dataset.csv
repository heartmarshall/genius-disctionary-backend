Don't you know you might find
A better place to play?
You said that you'd never been
But all the things that you've seen
Will slowly fade away

So I start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait
She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
Her soul slides away
""But don't look back in anger,"" I heard you say

Take me to the place where you go
Where nobody knows
If it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

And so, Sally can wait

He lives under a waterfall

Nobody can ever hear him call
Nobody can ever hear him call

You need to be yourself
You can't be no one else

She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train
And she makes me laugh
I got her autograph
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter
She's sniffing in a tissue selling the Big Issue

Where is it?
One
There it is
Two, three, four!

Take the time to make some sense
Of what you wanna say
And cast your words away upon the waves
And sail them home with acquiesce
On a ship of hope today
And as they land upon the shore
Tell them not to fear no more
Say it loud and sing it proud today

And then dance if you wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't
Know how it's gonna be
Please brother let it be
Life on the other hand
Won't make us understand
We're all part of a masterplan
Say it loud and sing it proud today

I'm not saying right is wrong
It's up to us to make
The best of all the things that come our way
'Cause everything that's been has passed
The answer's in the looking glass
There's four and twenty million doors
On life's endless corridor
Say it loud and sing it proud and they

Will dance if they wanna dance
Please brother take a chance
You know they're gonna go
Which way they wanna go
All we know is that we don't
Know how it's gonna be

Or I could steal a car (Steal a car, mum)

Her name was
Avaline (

To have a good time
But she was with her mum who had a face like a nun in pain (

She said her name
was Dot

You're bringing back those memories of the things that we did
You're hanging 'round and climbing trees, pretending to fly
D'you wanna be a spaceman and live in the sky? (Ah-ah)

You got how many bills to pay and how many kids?
And you forgot about the things that we did
The town where we're living has made you a man
And all of your dreams are washed away in the sand

Well, it's alright, it's alright
Who are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?
Do you still feel like me? (Do you feel like me?)
We sit down here and we shall see (We shall see)
We can talk and find common ground (Common ground)
And we can just forget about feeling down (Ha-ah-ah)
We can just forget about life in this town (Ha-ah, ah-ah)

It's funny how your dreams change as you're growing old
You don't wanna be no spaceman, you just want the gold
All the dream stealers are lying in wait
But if you wanna be a spaceman, it's still not too late

Well, it's alright and it's alright
Who are you and me to say what's wrong and what's right?
Do you still feel like me? (Do you feel like me?)
We sit down here and we shall see (We shall see)
We can talk about common ground (Common ground)
And we can just forget about feeling down (Ah-ah-ah)
We can just forget about life in this town (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ah-ah)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah"

Is a storyteller sleeping alone
He has no face and he has no name
And his whereabouts are sort of unknown

All he needs is his life in a suitcase
It belongs to a friend of a friend
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again

So wish me away to an unknown place
Am I living in a land with no name
I'll be making a start with my brand new heart
Stop me making sense once again

All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again

All we need is our lives in a suitcase
They belong to a friend of a friend's
And as we drink to ourselves
We'll amuse ourselves
Underneath the sky, underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Underneath the sky again
Again, again
Underneath the sky again"

This town holds no more for me
All my life I try to find another way
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down, I think you're rude
All my life I try to make a better day

It's hard enough being alone
Sitting here by the phone
Waiting for my memories
To come and play

It's hard enough sitting there
Rocking in your rocking chair
It's all too much for me to take
When you're not there

It's hard enough being alone
Sitting here by the phone
Waiting for my memories
To come and play

It's hard enough sitting there
Rocking in your rocking chair
It's all too much for me to take
When you're not there

I'm older than I wish to be
This town holds no more for me
All my life I try to find another way
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down, I think you're rude
All my life I try to make a better day

It's hard enough being alone
Sitting here by the phone
Waiting for my memories
To come and play

It's hard enough sitting there
Rocking in your rocking chair
It's all too much for me to take

And that is why I gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's no disgrace
'Cause in the end the past means nothing
You tell me I'm free, then you tie me down
And from my chains I think it's a pity
What did it cost you to wear my crown?
You don't like me, why don't you admit it?

I feel a little down today
And I ain't got much to say
But you're gonna miss me when I'm not there
You know I don't care
You know I don't care

As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss, and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall
'Cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name

You'll never forget my name

You're trying hard to put me in my place
And that is why I gotta keep running
The future is mine and it's your disgrace
'Cause in the end your life means nothing

D'you feel a little down today?
Bet you ain't got much to say
Who's gonna miss you when you're not there?
You know we don't care
You know we don't care

'Cause as we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall
'Cause baby after all
You'll never forget my name

You'll never forget my name

As we beg and steal and borrow
Life is hit and miss and this
I hope, I think, I know
If I ever hear the names you call
And if I stumble catch me when I fall

You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name
You'll never forget my name"
