The turning point of a career
In Korea being insincere
The holiday was fun-packed

Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now, see just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
Confidence taken in
By a suntan and a grin

The tenderest of care

I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through

Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle

Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

For not listening to advice

On the policy of truth

Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilized
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth

Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before

Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell

You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

Sixteen candles burn in her mind

She goes down on her knees and prays

Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car, ended up
On a life-support machine

Summer's day, as she passed away
Birds were singing in the summer sky
Then came the rain, and once again
A tear fell from her mother's eye

She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me

I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light
All the things I detest I will almost like
I don't want to be tied to anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear of those things
But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly
Though things like this make me sick
In a case like this, I'll get away with it"

Forbidden fruits for me to eat

Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes

Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
But I promise now, my judge and jurors
My intentions couldn't have been purer
My case is easy to see

I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what I've been through
And before we talk of any repentance

One we've never reached

You know we're sinking
We could fade away

Won't be denied

A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain

When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude

I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of
control

Can you say what you're trying to play anyway?
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled

All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true

There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance unknown
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown

I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air, I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair

All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true"

A frozen heart, an empty space
Something's changed and it's in your eyes
Please don't speak, you'll only lie

I found treasure not where I thought
Peace of mind can't be bought
Still, I believe

I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell

An angel led me when I was blind
I said, ""Take me back, I've changed my mind""
Now I believe
From the blackest room, I was torn
You called my name, a love was born
So I believe

I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell
I just hang on, suffer well
Sometimes it's hard, it's hard to tell"

I can't fake
I can't act
My hands shake
There's disclosure
I must make

There is so much love in me

I can't run
I have tried
There's a thorn
In my side
There is something
I can't hide

There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

There's a fire
In my veins
The desire
Causes pain
I will say it
Again

There is so much love in me

You can forsake me
Try to break me
But you can't shake me
No
You can despise me
Demonise me
It satisfies me
So

There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me
There is so much love in me"

I heard you call my name
Lying, on the bathroom floor
No one here to blame
There's a message I know can be found
I'm listening, I hear you, your sound

Speak to me, in a language
That I can understand
Tell me, that you're listening
Give me some kind of plan
Give me something, you'd be my drug of choice
You lead me, I follow, your voice

I will disappoint you
I will let you down
I need to know
You're here with me
Turn it all around
I'd be grateful, I'd follow you around
I'm listening, I'm here now, I'm found"

What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum, hey scum
What are you going to do when karma comes

A' calling
And you're falling
And there's nowhere left to run
And you're weeping
And not sleeping
And you're begging for your gun

Pull the trigger

Hey scum, hey scum
What have you ever done for anyone
Hey scum, hey scum
What will you do when judgement time has come

And you're kneeling
And you're squealing
And you're looking for someone
To bear witness
To your goodness
You can't even find your son

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

You wouldn't even offer up your crumbs
To the dying
And the crying
You're dead inside, you're numb
You're hollow
And shallow
Your empty life is done

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Hey scum, hey scum
Pull the trigger
Hey scum, hey scum
Pull the trigger"

And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit red danger

Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

Transition to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Your features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen, now show me

Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

Your face is hidden and we're out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answer's nowhere

Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life

I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light

I'll be the corpse
You'll be the thriller
And I'll be the drama, of course
If you play the sinner
I'll play the stain
If you play the winner
I'll be your permanent pain

I'll be the boredom
You, the desire
I'll be the catcalls
And you'll be the sound of the choir
You, anesthetic
I'll be the scream
You'll be the promise
And I'll be the end of your drеams

So don't say you love me
'Cause you'll nеver love me

You'll be the flowers
That some lover sent
I'll be the goodbye
Note that is hiding in them
You are the singer
I am the song
The tune that will linger
The bitter taste left on your tongue

So don't say you love me
How could you love me?

Your flowers and your make-believe
The secrets and the notes you keep
The promises left on the sheets
You'll never love me
Fool your friends, believe your lies
Make amends and alibis
In the end you can't disguise
That you'll never love me

You'll be the killer
I'll be the corpse
You'll be the laughter
And I'll be the punchline, of course"

With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train

Caroline leaks through holes in her skin
Her promise of sweetness
Forgiveness and everything
Caroline's monkey coos in her ear
Drives like a demon
Through Caroline's tears

Caroline feels the ice in her veins
The minutes and hours
The naming of days
Caroline said her drеam never ends
For Carolinе's monkey
And Caroline's friends

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing
Sometimes

Caroline's monkey claws at her back
Colder than winter
Darker than black
Caroline's monkey is hungry again
Running with scissors
On needles and pins

Caroline's monkey lives where she lays
Sleeps like a thief
And steals through the days
Caroline's monkey makes up all the fun
Leaves chaos and ruin
On Caroline's tongue

Caroline knows how fragile we are
With hope as our faith
We look to the stars
Caroline's monkey is crying again
There's no satisfaction
On Caroline's train

Fading's better than failing
Falling's better than feeling
Folding's better than losing
Fixing's better than healing
Sometimes"
