Gore]\nAll this running around, well, it's getting me down\nJust give me a pain that I'm used to\nI don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive\nYou just need to achieve something that rings true\n\n[Verse 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]\nThere's a hole in your soul like an animal\nWith no conscience repentance unknown\nClose your eyes, pay the price for your paradise\nDevils feed on the seeds that are sown\n\n[Verse 4: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]\nI can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real\nNo mistaking the faking, I care\nWith a prayer in the air, I will leave it there\nOn a note full of hope not despair\n\n[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]\nAll this running around, well, it's getting me down\nJust give me a pain that I'm used to\nI don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive\nYou just need to achieve something that rings true\nAll this running around, well, it's getting me down\nJust give me a pain that I'm used to\nI don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive\nYou just need to achieve something that rings true",
