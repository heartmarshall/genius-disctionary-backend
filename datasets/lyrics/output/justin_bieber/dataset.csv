And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

When I was thirteen, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and nobody came between us nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy, oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks (Woo)
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazin', 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is"

And you know I don't wanna lose that, 'cause I still believe in us

I still believe in love, I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us, the way I believe in us, you don't see
'Cause what you don't see is when we don't speak, I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to you

I wanna know if you feel it the way that I feel it

Don’t waste another dime, that's good jukebox money
And if you kiss me, I might yell out, ""Hallelujah""
And if you miss me, I’m runnin' right to ya, givin' you devotion
And if you touch me, I might holler like, ""Oh, man""
Baby, play another slow jam, give me some devotion

Sweet
Sweet, all day
Sweet, all day, devotion
Sweet
Sweet devotion"

Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual, yeah

Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

Just to think that we've been out here this whole time
Workin' through the seasons
Never crossed paths 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (So habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah (No)
Never ungrateful for it (Never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it (Oh)
Habitual (Ooh, ooh)
Can't nobody keep me like you (Oh, keep me like you)
Call it unconventional (Call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (Our love is habitual, oh)

Some days I burn like fire

So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

Sometimes I'll go to sleep early
Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

Don't pretend I got a reason to call you, it's not true
I only got a couple people to talk to, and it's not you (Yeah)
And I don't even got the patience to argue
So are you out of your mind?
I got a lotta reasons to fight
I got a lotta reasons to drive over you, but I
I put my pride to the side, I put my, I put my
Never stopped, had to take a turn and turn it into something that's new
Say you missed me, wasn't missing, is it clocking to you?
Wait and see 'cause it's something new and improved, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Heat checking, uh, heat chеcking these chickens, uh, yеah
And I go speed racing, speed racing for the record, uh, yeah
And I achieve greatness, I'm getting better by the second, uh, yeah
And I go speed racing, we ain't finished, we ain't finished just yet
Don't stress, don't stress it, baby, uh

I keep creeping, I keep creeping (Mm, yeah), uh
A speed demon, speed demon, uh
So keep dreaming, I can't see 'em, uh
A speed demon, speed demon, yeah

They try to say I'm out of my mind (Mm-mm)
But now they're singing every line (Out of my mind)
Uh, sing it
I got a lotta mountains to climb (Mm-hm, mm-hm)
Had to leave some baggage behind (Yeah, mm-hm)
And there's something that's stronger than me
That's paving me a new lane and giving me an energy
And there's something in the way she make me certain I'm enough
Everyday she put the loving on me
And all the people that be doubting on me
They came to witness my redemption, now they up out my seat
Got 'em tapping their feet, uh
Had to put my heart on my sleeve, uh, yeah

I said heat checking, uh, heat checking these chickens, uh, yeah
And I go speed racing, speed racing for the record, uh, yeah
And I achieve greatness, I'm gettin' better by the second, uh, yeah (I'm getting better by, oh-oh)
And I go speed racing, we ain't finished, we ain't finished just yet
Don't stress, don't stress it, baby, uh

Fast forward until we find it, uh
And press stop, but let me rewind it, uh
In case you ever needed reminding
That better keeps getting better, uh
I won it by a million miles
You already know what the time is (Okay, yeah)
It's forever, forever ever, I said forever
