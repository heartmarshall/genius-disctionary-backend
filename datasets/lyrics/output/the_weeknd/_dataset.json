(Hero)\nYou need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero\nWho on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)\nMy heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle\nMass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men\nClutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture's comin'\nIt's all prophecy and if I gotta be\nSacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me? Take my pain for me?\nSave my soul for me? 'Cause I'm alone, you see\nIf I'm gon' die for you, if I'm gon' kill for you\nThen I'll spill this blood for you, hey\n\n[Bridge: The Weeknd]\nHey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)\nHey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)\nHey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)\nHey, hey (La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)\n\n[Chorus: The Weeknd]\nWho gon' pray for me?
