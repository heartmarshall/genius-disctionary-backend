Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into

Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & Louise Post,
Dave Grohl
]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & Louise Post,
Dave Grohl
]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, ""Dad, come on, please""
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy

And I wonder

If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when"

Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Wasting another night on plannin' my revenge

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench

I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then, I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

I could fit into my head

And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still, there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free!

Then sat and watched them burn?

Set me free, again
To keep alive a moment at a time
But still inside, a whisper to a riot
To sacrifice, but knowin' to survive
The first to climb another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign
Forever, whenever, I never wanna die
I never wanna die, I never wanna die!
I'm on my knees, I never wanna die!
I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire

Here lies a city on fire
Singin' along, the arsonist choir
Now here I go

It started with a spark
And burned into the dark
Now here I go

There is a river I found
Into the wild, under the ground
So here I go

A button on a string
And I heard everything
Now here I go, well

Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You have no choice, you have to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way

But in the end we all
Come from what's come before
So here I go, well

Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
You had no choice, you had to choose
Bid farewell to yesterday
Say goodbye, I'm on my way
I threw it all away because
I had to be what never was
Been so hungry, I could lie
Took my word, I took your wine
And held you in my bloody hands
These rattled bones and rubber bands
Washed them in the muddy water
Lookin' for a dime and found a quarter
But you can't make me change my name
You'll never make me change my name
Pay no mind, now ain't that something
Fuck it all, I came from nothing

I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
I'm something from nothing
You are my fuse
It goes oh, oh, oh

Spilling wine, thinking of the time

Rolling your eyes, I held your hand a while

Where are you now?
Who will show me how?

Wait for the sun
Say hello, maybe it will come
You watched the hummingbirds
Naming evеry one
Do you have a minute for mе?
If you don't mind, I'll be stopping by
Count all the little black clouds
Don't you worry, please don't worry

Say, have you heard the news today?
One flag was taken down
To raise another in its place
A heavy cross you bear
A stubborn heart remains unchanged
No home, no life, no love
No stranger singin' in your name

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Dear God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

Let's say we take this town
No king or queen of any state
Get up to shut it down
Open the streets and raise the gates
I know one wall to scale
I know a field without a name
Head on without a care
Before it's way too late

Maybe the season
The colors change in the valley skies
Oh, God, I've sealed my fate
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight

For every piece to fall in place
Forever gone without a trace
Your horizon takes its shape
No turnin' back, don't turn that page
Come now, I'm leavin' here tonight
Come now, let's leave it all behind
Is that the price you pay?
Runnin' through Hell, heaven can wait

Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead ends
Long road to ruin there in your eyes
Under the cold streetlights
No tomorrow, no dead end in sight"

No fear of my heart, absence of faith

Some I remember, some I forget
Some of them living, some of them dead

Somewhere a move might intended a gown at
Pissed at all the bowels
Always the blues and a delicate smile
Missed all of the sideways
Gull and noun, gull and noun
Chills and petty Band-Aids
Wrapped around
