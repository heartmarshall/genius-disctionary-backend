Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back

Oh-oh, I'll shut shit down for you, East Side boy
Oh-oh, yeah, I know I been down but I need that boy
Oh-oh, I'll shut shit down for you, East Side boy

Man, fuck this pity party
When I'm back up, I'm shootin' shots at everybody
Fuck all you niggas, y'all do not support nobody
Show up for y'all, but y'all don't show up for Lil Nassy
Look how I opened doors and everybody run in
A lot of y'all are just my peers, y'all ain't my friends
A lot of y'all say y'all love me, y'all just pretend
A lot of y'all watched me drown in that deep end

Oh-oh, yeah, I been down but I need that boy
Oh-oh, I'll shut shit down for you, East Side boy
Oh-oh, yeah, I know I been down but I need that boy
Oh-oh, I'll shut shit down for you, East Side boy

Ooh, I think I need that boy
I think I love, uh (You think you what?)
I think I love that boy
I think I wanna get up on him, ride upon that boy
I think I wanna get up on him, ride upon that boy
Yeah, I think I wanna ride (Ride), ride (Ride), ride (Ride)
Ride (Ride), ride (Ride), ride (Ride), ride (Ride)
I think I wanna ride (Ride), ride (Ride)
Ride (Ride), ride (Ride), ride (Ride)
Shut shit down for you, East Side boy

Bend over, that ass too fat (
What?

Bend over, that ass too fat (
Wha-what?
)
Bend over, that ass too fat (
What?

Bend over, that ass too fat (
Wha-what?

Bend over, that ass too fat (

On a B-list star, gettin' my A-list round

I'm so drunk that my shit went limp, ayе, aye, uh
Pour me some Hеnny, uh
To tell you the truth, nigga, I'm Papoose, I'ma need my Remy
In that brand new Tron like Jimmy
Uh, a nigga finna Turner like Timmy
Then hit my ex like, ""Baby, did you miss me?""
I'm tryna fuck you and fuck up my kidneys
Fuck up this drank, yeah, babe, that's polygamy

Everyone thought I'd be finished
""How could he get any bigger than the biggest record ever?""
Ho', I did it, and did it, and did it again
Look at the charts, who bigger than him?
I take the juice and I mix it with gin
I take your bitch and I mix it with him, damn, yeah
Top of the morning, top of the charts
Gettin' top on the top of the car
I've been on top, they all said I wouldn't pop
I can still write 'cause I pop

I used to sleep on the cot
Now I'm on the beach in Belize, got the hoes doin' X on the yacht
Look what God did
Niggas better recognize who I is
Whole world on my pee pee, yep, yep
Like cam make 'em, skeet-skeet
Wet, wet, Maybach go, ""Beep-beep"" (Skrrt)

Big Nas, come get that work

Lost and found, I can't find my shirt
Montero just popped a Perc
This feel like God is first

Buss it open and make it, uh
Buss it open and make it twerk

I would like for you to grab a glass of wine
And let me talk to you for a minute
Look

I was scared then, ain't scared now
Weren't ready then, but I'm ready now
Yeah, I'm on the way, yeah, I'm on the rise
On the way, yeah, I'm on the rise
Mind your business, I'm mindin' mine
Mind your business, I'm mindin' mine
Mind your business, I'm mindin' mine
Alright, okay, shit, let's talk infatuations
I like long black dick and I like long conversations
I like cuddlin' with my cats and I like boys who have a smell to 'em
Controversy king, yeah, I love to raise hell to 'em
Can't show me mercy, y'all hate I don't deserve it
I heard the shit y'all say about me when y'all in 'em churches
Y'all stanky booty bitches take my fun and make it misery
Hey, hey, hey, bitch, I'm still making history
Okay, I'm global, I'm back to taking over
This shit is gon' get scary like the ending of October
I told you that I told you long ago up on the roads
That I got just what they wanted in
Boy, I'm blessed, I'm born to win
I'm shittin' on niggas, like scat porn
I'm the one they turned they back on
Got fans in Brazil, I'm that known
Fell off for a minute, now I'm back on
I just do what I want, I don't care what they like
Say it with me, nigga (Bitch, I'm back like J. Christ)

Dream on, when the going get tough
Dream on, when it all gets rough

Dream on (Dream on), dream on (Dream on)
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on

I can ice my wristwatch out like I'm DLo
Walk into the party, everybody be like, ""There he goes""
Baby, I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I'm a CEO
Baby, I'm that nigga, I'm that boy, I'm that negro
Ha, I just put my neck on bling-blaow, like I'm DLo
I just put my daddy in a house, I am Diego
Baby, I'm a boss (I'm a boss), I'm a CEO
Niggas keep on wishin' I might fall, tell 'em, ""Dream on""

Dream on, when the going get tough
Dream on, when it all gets rough

I'm your freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky fantasy (Dream boy)
I'm the nigga that they came to see
I'm on Nasarati road, made a lane for me
Fifty million records sold, I am playin' for keeps
Lil' nigga, you ain't seen the same fame as me
Lil' boy, you ain't faced the same pain as me
You ain't that, you ain't hot, you ain't trim like him
You ain't me, bitch, you just like them

Now, can I get a D (D)
R (R), E-A (E-A)
M (You can get an M, dream)
D (D), R (R), E-A (E-A)

Fuck it up, dream, fuck it up, dream
Ah-ah-ah, go dream, go, go, dream
Fuck it up, dream, fuck it up, dream
Ah-ah-ah, dream ain't got no drawers on
Yeah, got no drawers on
Dream ain't got no drawers on
Ain't got no drawers on
