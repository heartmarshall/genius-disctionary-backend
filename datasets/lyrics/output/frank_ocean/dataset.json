I figured it'd be good to clarify..Whoever you are. Wherever you are..\n\nI'm starting to think we're a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness.\nAll wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I've screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow.\n4 summers ago, I met somebody.\n\nI was 19 years old. He was too.\nWe spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile. I'd hear his conversation and his silence.. until it was time to sleep.\nSleep I would often share with him.\nBy the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love,\nit changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with.\nI reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time.\nI realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak.\nI realized too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn't in a plane though.\nI was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in\n. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth.\nI grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself.\nHe patted my back. He said kind things.\nHe did his best, but he wouldn't admit the same. He had to go back inside soon,\nit was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs.\nHe wouldn't tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I'd only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn't on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn't imagine keeping up my life without him.\n\nI struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn't always successful.\nThe dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It's winter now. I'm typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat.\nIt's December 27, 2011.\n\nBy now I've written two albums. This being the second.\nI wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine.\nI tried to channel overwhelming emotions.\nI'm surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I'd told some people my story.\nI'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans,\nprobably angels. I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks.\nTo my first love, I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn't what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was.\n\nSome things never are.. and we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you.\n\nI'll remember who you were and how we've both changed and stayed the same.\nI've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I'm only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good.\nI feel like a free man.\n\nIf I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too.\n- Frank"

Who knew?\nThat after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan\nOut of you too, you too, you too\nWhen I met you, you were Thom Yorke\nChris Martin and U2, U2, U2\nWhen you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C\nBun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah\n\nBut we're both a long way from home\nWe got the windows down, the radio's on, always\n\nI wrote a letter to the sky\nSaying, \"Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me\"\nMy girl found it in the car and said\n\"Baby, why you trying to diss me?\"\n'Cause you know you're my baby\nOh, you know you're my baby, ooh\nI'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride\n\nYeah, oh, ah\nYeah, oh, ah\nYeah, oh\nYeah, oh\n\nYou said, \"One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode\"\nWell, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone\nYou hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs\nSo now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot\n\nI know we're both a long way from home\nJust keep the windows down, the radio's on, always\n\nI wrote a letter to the sky\nSaying, \"Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me\"\nMy girl found it in the car and said\n\"Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?\"\nDon't you know you're my baby?\nDon't you know you're my baby, ooh?\nI'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah\n\nYou'll live a better life\n(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)\nA dull life ain't nothing\nDon't speed, who cares what car you're driving?\nNo Benz can make you friends\nShe don't care what car I'm driving\nAnd no Bentley can kiss me back\nThis song is dedicated to my '91 Acura\nMy 1991"

    "lyrics": "Haha, when I was younger\nI used to wonder, like…\n\nIf I was singing songs just to sing the songs\nOr if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted\nI couldn't play guitar like Van Halen\nHad no secret chords like Saint David\nBut you still came around, ate your lunch with me\nUsed to park your car to try the bus with me\nBut I would say, \"Girl, don't be dumb—\nI'm riding shotgun\"\n\nWe could go to my house after school\nAfter school, after school\n'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late\nOff 'til late, off 'til late\nWe could kick it in the living room\nLooking through my whole vinyl collection\nAnd you could teach me how to slow dance or something\nAnd I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin\n\nAnd every time somebody ask me\nIf I sing songs to get at women\nI say, \"Yeah,\" they say, \"No fair, no fair, it's cheating\"\nI say, \"Shit, oh well, oh well,\" ha\nAnd every time a nigga ask me\nIf I sing songs to get at women\nI say, \"Yeah,\" they say, \"No fair, no fair, it's cheating\"\nI say, \"Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me…\"\n\nYou'd be singin' to her\nLike, \"La-da, da-da-da\nLa-da, da-da-da\nLa-da, da-da-da\"\n\nNow I'm in the lab, always working late\nAlways sleeping past the breakfast she makes\nShe used to stop by, come and holler at me\nPut her purse down, and try to battle-rap me\nShe don't do that no more\nNo more, no more\nDon't even listen to the songs I record\nBut she be banging that Drake in my car\nI'm so far gone\nShe stay blasting Trey and his songs\nAll damn day long\nIt's like she never heard of me, heard of me\n\nNow, every time somebody ask me\nIf I sing songs to get my women\nI say, \"Nah,\" they say, \"Okay, I don't believe it\"\nI say, \"Nope, I swear, I never do it\"\nAnd every time a nigga ask me\nIf I sing songs to get at women\nI say, \"Nah,\" they say, \"Who do you think you kidding?\nI know you, you stole my girlfriend\"\n\nAh, ah (Ooh, ooh, ah)\nOoh, ah, yeah\nFair enough\nYou see, I just don't play fair\nBut it's fair enough\n'Cause your girl broke my heart in half, uh-ah\nI'm singing, \"La-da, da-da,\" 'bout heartbreak\nAnd now, I'm singing, \"La-da, da-da,\" 'bout love lost\n\nOoh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh\n\nDamn, haha\nI'm saying though, like…\nAll I write is love songs\nAnd I try\nI come to the studio\nI—you know what I do\nWhat you think I do it for? Huh?\nYeah, uh-huh\nBut you ain't listening, never\nBut if you were…\nYou might fuck wit' it\nHaha, yeah\nAll these songs for women\nSongs for women\nSongs for you, baby\nFor you"
