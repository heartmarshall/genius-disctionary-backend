Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though

I'm lying down thinkin' 'bout you, ooh, no, no, no
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' 'bout you, do you think about me still? (Do ya, do ya?)
Do ya, do ya? (Do ya, do ya?)

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget)
How you feel? (How you feel?)
You know you were my first time (Time)
A new feel (Down)
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever, ooh"

Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see-through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (Bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up? (Breathe)
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh (Breathe)
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, 'nani-'nani
This feel like a Quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body (Ah)

New beginnings, ahh
New beginnings, wake up, akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
Every night shit, every day shit

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit
Every day shit (Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you're outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up (Night, come on)
On God, you should match it, it's that KO (That KO, God)
No white lighters 'til I fuck my twenty-eighth up (Fire)
1998, my family had that Acura (Fire)
Oh, the Legend (Fire)
Kept at least six discs in the changer (Yeah-yeah)
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active (Massive)
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions (Massive)
All the reverends (Massive, massive, ooh)
Preachin' self-made millionaire status (Yeah, yeah)
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion (Yeah, yeah)
After 'Trina hit, I had to transfer campus (Yeah, yeah)
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address (Ooh)
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress (Fuckin')
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night (Right now, right now, right now)

Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that ""spend the night"" shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that 'na-'na, though, could you come by?
Fuck wit' me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
Bummed out, stressed out
That's just every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation (Day shit)
Every day shit, every night shit (Every night shit, every day shit)
Every day shit, every day shit (Every night shit, every night shit)
Every day shit, every day shit (Every night shit, every night shit)

Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

Austin Feinstein

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me

It's nothing, it's nothing

Sometimes, you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights, you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

What do you think my brain is made for?
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter

Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter

Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure
Oh, no, no

What if the sky and the stars are for show?
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet, then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothin' mattered

Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

Hey, hey

Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, ""Nah
She better with some fella with a regular job""
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner, Mr. Benjamin was sittin' in awe
Hopped into my car, drove far
Far's too close, and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were unsouthern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're bad at being good (Ah-ha, oh)

Knock, knock on wood, hey (Ah-ha-ah)
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
You're bad at being good (For heaven's sakes, go to hell, knock on wood)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell (Would have ya)
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood

The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's
Had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'
The start of nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me
The start of nothin'
Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'
And we started from nothin'
Ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you
I've been dreamin', dreamin'"

The throne of our queen is empty (Cle-o-patra, Cleopatra)

In a rocky world, rocky-ky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor, ah-ooh
Chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go?
The way you say my name makes me feel like I'm that nigga
But I'm still unemployed
You could say it's big, but you take it

Stick by me, close by me

You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

You're catchin' that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grape vines, mango, peaches, and lime

A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life, live and die in the life

You've had a landscaper and a housekeeper since you were born (Yeah)
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach

And the water is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it'd be (Thought it'd be)

Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge

But we were so in love
We had an American wedding

She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, ""I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far"" (Oh)

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

Don't let 'em front you, they sayin' you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new

Ain't gon' be trippin' over some bitch-ass dude

Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else, don't try to act like someone else
Be yourself, be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads
They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's, um, control
Then it's regulated
Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye"

I figured it'd be good to clarify..Whoever you are. Wherever you are..

I'm starting to think we're a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness.
All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to. My loved ones are everything to me here. In the last year or 3 I've screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation. Mercy maybe. For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow.
4 summers ago, I met somebody.

I was 19 years old. He was too.
We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I'd see him, and his smile. I'd hear his conversation and his silence.. until it was time to sleep.
Sleep I would often share with him.
By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love,
it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with.
I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager.. The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time.
I realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak.
I realized too much, too quickly. Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn't in a plane though.
I was in a Nissan Maxima, the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in
. I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth.
I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself.
He patted my back. He said kind things.
He did his best, but he wouldn't admit the same. He had to go back inside soon,
it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs.
He wouldn't tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years. I felt like I'd only imagined reciprocity for years. Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn't on a cliff. I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths. I took the breaths and carried on. I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn't imagine keeping up my life without him.

I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn't always successful.
The dance went on.. I kept the rhythm for several summers after. It's winter now. I'm typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. I flew home for another marred Christmas. I have a windowseat.
It's December 27, 2011.

By now I've written two albums. This being the second.
I wrote to keep myself busy and sane. I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine.
I tried to channel overwhelming emotions.
I'm surprised at how far all of it has taken me. Before writing this I'd told some people my story.
I'm sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans,
probably angels. I don't know what happens now, and that's alrite. I don't have any secrets I need kept anymore. There's probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean. I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was. I don't think I ever could be. Thanks.
To my first love, I'm grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn't what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was.

Some things never are.. and we were. I won't forget you. I won't forget the summer. I'll remember who I was when I met you.

I'll remember who you were and how we've both changed and stayed the same.
I've never had more respect for life and living than I have right now. Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive. Thanks. To my mother. You raised me strong. I know I'm only brave because you were first. So thank you. All of you. For everything good.
I feel like a free man.

If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too.
- Frank"

We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self-contained and aware
Of each other's forms still and in full strides
Just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Coddled and pacified
By versions of mothers

It's all new to me

Having you around
It's all new to me
It's all new to me

What if we decide to live by choice?
All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on after genius ends
I watch video
Only difference is flattened and remiss
Sparks of lightning storm behind wet faces
Slipped my pants back on and rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone

I'll be back before
The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no, not at all
And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you showed
What you give, my words can't hold
And if acts of God breaks us apart

On this side (Down, down)
Fuck the other side (Now)
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side (Now)
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside
I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life (Now)
Mothers of us, be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us, be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely (Now)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah

We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucker
Pretty sweet
Pretty sweet"

I'm like, who knew? Who knew? Who knew?
That after all the years, I'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too, you too, you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke
Chris Martin and U2, U2, U2
When you met me, I was Three 6, Pimp C
Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, ""Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me""
My girl found it in the car and said
""Baby, why you trying to diss me?""
'Cause you know you're my baby
Oh, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride

Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh, ah
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh

You said, ""One day, I'll start up my car and it'll explode""
Well, now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel while I hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down, the radio's on, always

I wrote a letter to the sky
Saying, ""Maybe one day you'll get to kiss me, kiss me, kiss me""
My girl found it in the car and said
""Baby, why you trying to diss me, diss me, diss me?""
Don't you know you're my baby?
Don't you know you're my baby, ooh?
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

You'll live a better life
(A better life, young one, a better life, young one)
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speed, who cares what car you're driving?
No Benz can make you friends
She don't care what car I'm driving
And no Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Acura
My 1991"

I used to wonder, like…

If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""

We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Shit, oh well, oh well,"" ha
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me…""

You'd be singin' to her
Like, ""La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da""

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say, ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""

Ah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ah)
Ooh, ah, yeah
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half, uh-ah
I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da,"" 'bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da,"" 'bout love lost

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Damn, haha
I'm saying though, like…
All I write is love songs
And I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were…
You might fuck wit' it
Haha, yeah
All these songs for women
Songs for women
Songs for you, baby
For you"
