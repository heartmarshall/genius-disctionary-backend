    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHello, darkness, my old friend\nI've come to talk with you again\nBecause a vision softly creeping\nLeft its seeds while I was sleeping\nAnd the vision that was planted in my brain\nStill remains\nWithin the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn restless dreams, I walked alone\nNarrow streets of cobblestone\n'Neath the halo of a street lamp\nI turned my collar to the cold and damp\nWhen my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light\nThat split the night\nAnd touched the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd in the naked light, I saw\nTen thousand people, maybe more\nPeople talking without speaking\nPeople hearing without listening\nPeople writing songs that voices never shared\nAnd no one dared\nDisturb the sound of silence\n\n[Verse 4]\n\"Fools,\" said I, \"You do not know\nSilence, like a cancer, grows\nHear my words that I might teach you\nTake my arms that I might reach you\"\nBut my words, like silent raindrops, fell\nAnd echoed in the wells of silence\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd the people bowed and prayed\nTo the neon god they made\nAnd the sign flashed out its warning\nIn the words that it was forming\nAnd the sign said, \"The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls\nAnd tenement halls\nAnd whispered in the sound of silence\"",

The recent fight in the House of Representatives was over the open housing\nSection of the Civil Rights Bill brought traditional enemies together but it left the defenders of the measure without the votes of their strongest supporters. President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination by everyone for every type of housing but it had no chance from the start, and everyone in Congress knew it. A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee\n\nIn Los Angeles today, comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an overdose of narcotics. Bruce was 42 years old\n\nDr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero. Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call off the march and the police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out if it is held. King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago tuesday\n\nIn Chicago, Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought before a grand jury today for indictment. The nurses were found stabbed and strangled in their Chicago apartment\n\nIn Washington the atmosphere was tense today as a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities continued its probe into anti-Vietnam war protests. Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting anti-war slogans. Former Vice-President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial increase in the present war effort in Viet nam, the U.S. should look forward to five more years of war. In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the U.S\n\nThat's the 7 o'clock edition of the news.

    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nHe was a most peculiar man\nThat's what Mrs. Riordan says\nAnd she should know\nShe lived upstairs from him\nShe said he was a most peculiar man\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was a most peculiar man\nHe lived all alone\nWithin a house\nWithin a room\nWithin himself\nA most peculiar man\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe had no friends\nHe seldom spoke\nAnd no one in turn ever spoke to him\n'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care\nAnd he wasn't like them\nOh no, he was a most peculiar man\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe died last Saturday\nHe turned on the gas\nAnd he went to sleep\nWith the windows closed\nSo he'd never wake up\nTo his silent world\nAnd his tiny room\nAnd Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere\nWho should be notified soon\n\n[Outro]\nAnd all the people said\n\"What a shame that he's dead\nBut wasn't he a most peculiar man?\"",
