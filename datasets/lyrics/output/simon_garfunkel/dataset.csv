I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words, like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence"""

I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmm

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages
I come lookin' for a job but I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, la la la la la la la

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
On the side of a hill, in the deep forest green
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Tracing of sparrow on snow-crested ground
Without no seams nor needlework
Blankets and bedclothes, the child of the mountain
Then she'll be a true love of mine
Sleeps unaware of
the clarion call

Tell her to find me an acre of land
On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Washes the grave with silvery tears
Between the saltwater and the sea strands
A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Generals order their soldiers to kill
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

Remember me to one who lives there

And walked off to look for America

""Kathy,"" I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
""Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America""

Laughing on the bus
Playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, ""Be careful, his bowtie is really a camera""

""Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat""
""We smoked the last one an hour ago""
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field

""Kathy, I'm lost,"" I said, though I knew she was sleeping
""I'm empty and aching and I don't know why""
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America

In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window
To the streets below
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow

I am a rock
I am an island

I've built walls
A fortress, steep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship
Friendship causes pain
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain

I am a rock
I am an island

Don't talk of love
Well, I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber
Of feelings that have died
If I never loved, I never would have cried

I am a rock
I am an island

I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room
Safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me

I am a rock
I am an island

And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries"

Weave their weary paths and die

Ah, seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?

Funny how my memory skips

Giraffes are insincere
And the elephants are kindly, but they're dumb
Orangutans are skeptical
Of changes in their cages

Zebras are reactionaries
Antelopes are missionaries
Pigeons plot in secrecy
And hamsters turn on frequently

I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand
On Bleecker Street

A poet reads his crooked rhyme
Holy, holy is his sacrament
Thirty dollars pays your rent
On Bleecker Street

I heard a church bell softly chime
In a melody sustaining
It's a long road to Canaan
On Bleecker Street

Mmm
Ooh

As the sun shines through the curtained lace

And we sit and drink our coffee
Couched in our indifference
Like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar

In the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives

And you read your Emily Dickinson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm
Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time

And the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives

Yes, we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
""Can analysis be worthwhile?""
""Is the theater really dead?""
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow
I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me

Lost in the dangling conversation
And the superficial sighs

This is the early evening edition of the news. The recent fight in the House of Representatives was over the open housing
Section of the Civil Rights Bill brought traditional enemies together but it left the defenders of the measure without the votes of their strongest supporters. President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination by everyone for every type of housing but it had no chance from the start, and everyone in Congress knew it. A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee

In Los Angeles today, comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an overdose of narcotics. Bruce was 42 years old

Dr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero. Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call off the march and the police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out if it is held. King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago tuesday

In Chicago, Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought before a grand jury today for indictment. The nurses were found stabbed and strangled in their Chicago apartment

In Washington the atmosphere was tense today as a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities continued its probe into anti-Vietnam war protests. Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting anti-war slogans. Former Vice-President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial increase in the present war effort in Viet nam, the U.S. should look forward to five more years of war. In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the U.S

And the paper they were signing said

And when the papers all were signed
And a million copies made
They all joined hands and bowed their heads
And grateful prayers were prayed

And the people in the streets below
Were dancing round and round
And guns and swords and uniforms
Were scattered on the ground

And in the dark deserted station
Restless in anticipation
A man waits in the shadows

His restless eyes leap and scratch
At all that they can touch or catch
And hidden deep within his pocket
Safe within its silent socket
He holds a colored crayon

Now from the tunnel's stony womb
The carriage rides to meet the groom
And opens wide and welcome doors
But he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows

And the train is gone suddenly
On wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany
And he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand

Now from his pocket quick he flashes
The crayon on the wall he slashes
Deep upon the advertising
A single worded poem comprised
Of four letters

And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding
The poem across the tracks rebounding
Shadowed by the exit light
His legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night"

Till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance
That might have been

Bye bye, love
Bye bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love
Bye bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, goodbye

I'm through with romance
I'm through with love
I'm through with counting
The stars above
And here's the reason
That I'm so free
My loving baby
Is through with me

Bye bye, love
Bye bye, happiness
Hello, loneliness
I think I'm gonna cry
Bye bye, love
Bye bye, sweet caress
Hello, emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye
Bye bye, my love, goodbye"

Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows
Blessed are the sat upon, spat upon, ratted on
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?

I got no place to go
I’ve walked around Soho for the last night or so
Ah, but it doesn’t matter, no

Blessed is the land and the kingdom
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to
Blessed are the meth drinkers, pot sellers, illusion dwellers
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?

My words trickle down
From a wound that I have no intention to heal

Blessed are the stained glass, windowpane glass
Blessed is the church service, makes me nervous
Blessed are the penny rookers, cheap hookers, groovy lookers
O Lord, why have you forsaken me?

I...
I have tended my own garden much too long"
"50","A Most Peculiar Man","Simon & Garfunkel","Sounds of Silence","","January 17, 1966","11658","150","29","","https://genius.com/Simon-and-garfunkel-a-most-peculiar-man-lyrics","79545","He was a most peculiar man
That's what Mrs. Riordan says
And she should know
She lived upstairs from him
She said he was a most peculiar man

He was a most peculiar man
He lived all alone
Within a house
Within a room
Within himself
A most peculiar man

He had no friends
He seldom spoke
And no one in turn ever spoke to him
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't care
And he wasn't like them
Oh no, he was a most peculiar man

He died last Saturday
He turned on the gas
And he went to sleep
With the windows closed
So he'd never wake up
To his silent world
And his tiny room
And Mrs. Riordan says he has a brother somewhere
Who should be notified soon

And all the people said
""What a shame that he's dead
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?"""
