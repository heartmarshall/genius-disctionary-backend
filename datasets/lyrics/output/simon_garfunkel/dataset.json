Why have I done it?\nI've committed a crime, broken the law\nFor twenty-five dollars and pieces of silver\nI held up and robbed a hard liquor store\n\nMy life seems unreal, my crime an illusion\nA scene badly written in which I must play\nYet, I know as I gaze at my young love beside me\nThe morning is just a few hours away"

The recent fight in the House of Representatives was over the open housing\nSection of the Civil Rights Bill brought traditional enemies together but it left the defenders of the measure without the votes of their strongest supporters. President Johnson originally proposed an outright ban covering discrimination by everyone for every type of housing but it had no chance from the start, and everyone in Congress knew it. A compromise was painfully worked out in the House Judiciary Committee\n\nIn Los Angeles today, comedian Lenny Bruce died of what was believed to be an overdose of narcotics. Bruce was 42 years old\n\nDr. Martin Luther King says he does not intend to cancel plans for an open housing march Sunday into the Chicago suburb of Cicero. Cook County Sheriff Richard Ogleby asked King to call off the march and the police in Cicero said they would ask the National Guard to be called out if it is held. King, now in Atlanta, Georgia, plans to return to Chicago tuesday\n\nIn Chicago, Richard Speck, accused murderer of nine student nurses, was brought before a grand jury today for indictment. The nurses were found stabbed and strangled in their Chicago apartment\n\nIn Washington the atmosphere was tense today as a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Un-American Activities continued its probe into anti-Vietnam war protests. Demonstrators were forcibly evicted from the hearings when they began chanting anti-war slogans. Former Vice-President Richard Nixon says that unless there is a substantial increase in the present war effort in Viet nam, the U.S. should look forward to five more years of war. In a speech before the Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in New York Nixon also said opposition to the war in this country is the greatest single weapon working against the U.S\n\nThat's the 7 o'clock edition of the news.
