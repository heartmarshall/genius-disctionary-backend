Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (You've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Do I wanna know) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall
(Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you?"

If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive

With your hands between your thighs and a smile"

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had

And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem
As daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up

Remember when the boys were all electric?
And now, when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca Dauber or a betting pencil?

I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?

Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be

And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)

And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger

She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella, oh
As Arabella
Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And a kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind

It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light

(Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope
(Asking if) I can have one of those

(Wraps her lips) 'Round the Mexican Coke

So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowin' when to stop
Sunglasses indoors
Par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I know
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want you
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on

The ""She's with me""s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the colour dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one

In the right place and time

When you know who's callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
'Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't comin' true

That you always thought didn't approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

And tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, ""I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"""

You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and you chewed
On the last of your pick 'n'  mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I loved that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along

Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
And unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
Even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along"

To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine

Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul"

Soundtracked by a chorus of ""You don't know what you're doing""

Explode behind my eyes like American sports

Or throwing her to the sharks?
