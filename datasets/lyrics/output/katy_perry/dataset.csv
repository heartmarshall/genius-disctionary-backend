Let's take a journey

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be somethin' in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Layin' underneath the palm trees (Yeah, yeah, undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (What? What? What? At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ayy)

Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh, oh

You could travel the world (You could travel the world)
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us (Once you party with us)

Wild, wild, West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones, I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (
Uh

The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay (Bay) just like I love L.A.​ (L.A.​)
Venice Beach and Palm Springs (Hey)
Summertime is everything
Homeboys bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis
No weenies, just the king and a queenie
Katy, my lady (Yeah?)
Look at here, baby (Uh-huh)

We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay

Trapped in our white picket fence

So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb

So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me
We're all chained to the rhythm

To the rhythm, to the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat

Break down the walls to connect, inspire

Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling and we about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions

Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

But this Friday night
Do it all again
But this Friday night
Do it all again

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, ""Draw the line""
And I do, I do

And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

And don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back

We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece

Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Gettin' stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next, alien sex?

See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do

See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)

But I wanted to share that side of my story, because I know there are so many other people out there that have gone through things like that, and you always feel like you're the only one going through that. You walk out the door, and you see someone you know, and they ask you how you are, and you just have to say you're fine when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it, because they would never understand.

We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

I know a bar out in Mars
Where they drivin' spaceships instead of cars
Cop a Prada space suit up out the stars
Gettin' stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next, alien sex?
I'ma disrobe you then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you, so I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural

Come close, let's flow
Anchor in me
And get lost at sea
The world's your oyster
And I am the pearl
Open waters
Sink into me slowly

So, baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

Don't fight, just ride
The rhythm of the tide
We swirl, we spin
Salted, sun-kissed skin
We float together
Whatever weather
Embrace the breeze
And sail away smoothly

So, baby, come and take a swim with me
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy
Don't be scared to dive in deep
And start a tsunami
Tsunami

Oh, you're waking up an ocean of emotion
That my body can't hide (Can't hide)
Tsunami (Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now you're soaked in my devotion
'Cause you opened up a paradise (Inside)
Tsunami (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Tsunami

So, baby, come and take a swim with me (Take a swim with me)
Make me ripple 'til I'm wavy (Make me ripple, baby)
Don't be scared to dive in deep (Don't be scared to)
And start a tsunami (Ayy)

I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a soldier for you, baby, I earned all my stripes, ah

Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
So now we know it's worth it
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far, ah (Uh)

'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now (Woo)

'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a baller for you, baby, I pay any price, ah

Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
Became a better version
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink (Uh)
