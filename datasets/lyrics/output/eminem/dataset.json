    "lyrics": "\"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\"\n\"But I'm only going to get this one chance\" (\nSix minutes—, six minutes—\n)\n\"Something's wrong, I can feel it\" (\nSix minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!\n)\n\"Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.\nIf that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;\nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\"\n\"You are just what the doc ordered\"\n\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot\n\nBut for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a livin' and a killin' off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (\nKill 'em all with\n)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match\nWith this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'\nBackpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nAnd at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce\n\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\n\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)\nMCs get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of\nshame\nYou fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-lookin' boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)\nYou're witnessin' a mass-occur\nLike you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy\n\"Oy vey, that boy's gay!\"—that's all they say, lookin' boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day, lookin' boy\nHey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre, lookin' boy\nI'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit\nGet outta my face, lookin' boy!\nBasically, boy, you're never gonna be capable\nOf keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—\n\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod\nThis planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard\n\nSo you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off, then I'm reloadin'\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'\nBut I got your mom deep-throatin'\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothin' in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes\nTo maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case 'cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come tryin'\nTo censor you like that one line\nI said on \"I'm Back\" from\nThe Mathers LP 1\nwhen I\nTried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (\nJ.J. Fad\n)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for\nSatan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard—be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?"

Everybody's jokin' now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow\nSnap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity\nOpe, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad\nBut he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it\nHe knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter\nHe's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant\nHe knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody\nBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nHis soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\nAs we move toward a new world order\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's\nClose to post-mortem, it only grows harder\nHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over\nThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows\nHe's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads\nGod only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera\nIs told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner\nBut the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my nine-to-\nFive and I can't provide the right type of life for my family\n'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder\nTryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter\nCaught up between bein' a father and a prima donna\nBaby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\nTo the point I'm like a snail, I've got\nTo formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got\nTo go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot\nSo here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better lose yourself in the music\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\nYou better\n\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\n\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\nSo Mama moved back onto Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\nAnd Mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh, Mama's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)"

How's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat\nAnyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance\nI ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans\nIf you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to\nBut you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\nThat's my little brother, man, he's only six years old\nWe waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, \"No\"\nThat's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol\nHe wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do\nI ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to\nRemember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back\nSee, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither\nHe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\nI can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs\nSo when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed\nI even got a tattoo with your name across the chest\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\nSee, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\nBut she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up\nYou gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose\nSincerely yours, Stan, PS: We should be together too\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Mr. I'm Too Good to Call or Write My Fans\nThis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months, and still no word, I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway\nHey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\"\nAbout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'\nBut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'\nNow it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy\nAnd all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it\nI hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me\nSee, Slim? Shut up, bitch, I'm tryna talk\nHey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?\n\nMy tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I\nGot out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window (Window)\nAnd I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could, it'd all be grey\nBut your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad (Bad)\n\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nAnd here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?\nI say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'\nTo help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was, it was you\nDamn"

want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\nI'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla\nYou're bringin' the killer within me outta me\nYou don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me\nAnd be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me's the epitome of a spitter\nWhen I'm in the vicinity,

There won't be no next time\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie"

Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are\nTo give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you\nYou mention me, millions of views, attention in news\nI mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you\nBillions of views, your ten cents are two\nSkim through the music to give shit reviews\nTo get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse\nDon't get misconstrued, business as us'\nShit-list renewed, so get shit to do\nOr get dissed 'cause I just don't get\nWhat the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to\nDo you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow\nEveryone copies though?

That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage\nThe Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!\"\nShout to all my colorblind people\nEach and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green\nAquamarine, or you think water is pink\n\"Dawg, that's a date\" — \"Looks like an olive to me\"\n\"Look, there's an apple!\" — \"No, it's not, it's a peach!\"\nSo finger-bang, Pootie Tang\nBurger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang\nCharlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say\nGive me Donkey of the Day\nWhat a way for 2018 to get underway\nBut I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say\nWelcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)\nInvite 'em in like a One A Day\nI'm not done (Preach!)\n'Cause I feel like the beast of burden\nThat line in the sand, was it even worth it?\n'Cause the way I see people turning's\nMakin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose\nI'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds\nAnd I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word\nHas the court of public opinion reached a verdict\nOr still yet to be determined?\n'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped\nBut if I could go back, I'd at least reword it\nAnd say I empathize with the people this evil serpent\nSold the dream to that he's deserted\nBut I think it's workin'\nThese verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous\nAnd he's too scurred to answer me with words\n'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered\nBut I know at least he's heard it\n'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service\nTo meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him\nOr ask if I'm linked to terrorists\nI said, \"Only when it comes to ink and lyricists\"\nBut my beef is more media journalists\n(Hold up, hold up, hold up)\nI said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist\nCan get a mouthful of flesh\nAnd yes, I mean eating a penis\n'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death\nSo I've been givin' the media fingers\nDon't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh\nBut they've been puttin' me through the ringer\nSo I ain't ironin' shit out with the press\nBut I just took this beat to the cleaners"

You embarrassed?\nThis guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence\nAnd Clarence lives at home with both parents\nAnd Clarence' parents have a real good marriage\nThis guy don't wanna battle, he's shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nHe's scared to death, he's scared to look\nAt his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!\nFuck a beat, I'll go acappella\nFuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer\nFuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!\nI'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly\nAnd fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie\nHere, tell these people something they don't know about me\n\nYo..."

(Hehe)\nWell, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be\n\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"

I can't find Mommy, where is she?\"\n\"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy\nDaddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself\nI'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself\"\nThen turn right around on that song and tell her you love her\nAnd put hands on her mother who's a spittin' image of her\nThat's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy\nShady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha\n\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\nAnd when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn\nRejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice\nJust know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'\nAnd I didn't feel a thing, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back\n\nI keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing\nShe keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing\n\"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?\"\n\"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more\" \"Daddy, you're lyin'\nYou always say that, you always say, 'This is the last time'\nBut you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine\"\nShe's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it\n\"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave!

Mind sayin', \"Let it go, fuck this\"\nHeart's sayin', \"I will, once I bury this bitch alive\nHide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset\" and\n\nI flee the scene\nLike it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth\nBut it's easier to justify what's bad is good\nAnd I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-run, follow me, I ruh-uh-run)\nI just hate to be the bad–\n\nAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch\nTo think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit\nThink you can hurt people and just keep gettin' away with it?\nNot this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch\nFinish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit\nThought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it\nYou left our family in shambles\nYou expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?\nMay be gone but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think 'cause he's been out the picture\nSo long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\nAnd the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold\nHave you any idea the shit that I've gone through?\nFeelin's I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?\nNot once you call to ask me how I'm doin'\nLetters, you don't respond to 'em\nFuck it, I'm comin' to see you\nAnd, gee, who better to talk to than you?\nThe cause of my problems\nMy life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on ya\nPoof, then I'm gone, voosh\n\nI flee the scene\nLike it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth\nBut it's easier to justify what's bad is good\nAnd I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-run, follow me, I ruh-uh-run)\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-run, follow me, I ruh-uh, ruh-uh-un)\n\nI've been drivin' around your side of this town\nLike nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now\nFinally, I found your new address, park in your drive\nFeel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life\nAnd it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva\nMy knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house\nSee, it's sad it came to this point\nSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment\nTo come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy\nI don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy\nIt's revenge that I seek, so I sneak\nVengefully and treat your bedroom window like I reached my full potential – I peeked (Haha)\nContinue to peep, still bent low, then keep\nTapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak\nAll the way 'round to the back porch\nMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this\nYou don't plan for intruders beforehand?\nSurprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?\nGag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung\nLike you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan\nDragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans\nIrony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?\nAnd here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck\nIt's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it\nWe're in a car right now—wait, here comes my favorite lyric\n\"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die\"\nAnd hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy\nHow's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun\nLast album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done\nEminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell\nBitch, I even have your initials, I initially was\nGonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it\nSince you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck\nThe best place you could be buried alive is right here\nTwo more exits, time is quite near\nHope we don't get stopped, no license I fear\nThat sirens I hear?\nGuess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea\nAs cops appear in my driver's side mirror\n(Oh, God, police, agh)\nHope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least\nNew plan, Stan\nSlim: \"Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car\"\nWell, gotta go, almost at the bridge\nHaha, big bro, it's for you, Slim, this is for him\nAnd Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good\nNow say you hate homos again\n\n[\nPart II\n]\n\nI also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend\nI'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in\nI'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen\nPerfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin\nNope, it's hopeless, I'm that denial that you're hopelessly in\nWhen they say all of this is approachin' its end\nBut you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again\nBack's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds, toilets clogged\nYeah, 'cause I'm talkin' a lot of shit, but I'm backin' it all up\nBut in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers\nAfter the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience\nI'm the ringin' in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils\nEatin' your vocal cords after your concerts\nI'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged, grab for some water\nBut I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow\nI'm the bullies you hate that you became\nWith every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya\nEvery woman you insult, batter\nBut the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters\nI represent everything you take for granted\n'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona's half a facade\nAnd Matthew and Stan's just symbolic\nOf you not knowin' what you have 'til it's gone\n'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are callin' your name\nCameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them\nI'm the hindsight to say, \"I told you so\"\nForeshadows of all the things that are to follow\nI'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow\nIf you don't stop after they call ya\nBiggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits\nWhen it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip, the baggage you have, but\nAs you gather up all your possessions\nIf there's anything you have left to say\n'Less it makes an impact then don't bother\nSo 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packin' a wallop\n\nSo, one last time, I'm back\n'Fore it fades into black and it's all over\nBehold the final chapter in a saga\nTryna recapture that lightnin' trapped in a bottle twice\nThe magic that started it all\nTragic portrait of an artist tortured\nTrapped in his own drawings\nTap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable\nHere goes a wild stab in the dark\nUh, as I pick up where the last Mathers left off"

My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach\nA far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as soon as I grab, squeeze\nI lose my grip like the flying trapeze\nInto the dark, I plummet, now the sky's blackening\nI know the mark’s high, butterflies rip apart my stomach\nKnowin' that no matter what bars I come with\nYou're gonna harp, gripe, and that's a hard Vicodin to swallow So I scrap these\nAs pressure increases like khakis\nI feel the ice cracking, because\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus (\nIt's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—\n)\nI walk on water (\nShit\n)\nBut only when it freezes\n\nIt's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set\nAlways in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet\nWill this step just be another misstep\nTo tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I’ve garnered?\nThe rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark\n'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart\nLike, \"This shit is garbage\"\nGod's given me all this, still, I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me as a god, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive\nAnd I try not to listen to nonsense\nBut if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence, mission accomplished\nI'm not God-sent\nNas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince, so\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water (\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—\n)\nBut only when it freezes (\nIt's true—\n)\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nMakin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\n\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess\nAt times, juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest\nA flawed human, I guess\nBut I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-\n​-pectations and meet 'em, but first, the \"Speedom\" verse\nNow Big Sean, he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm\nEvery album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\nBegs the question, though, especially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home\nIs burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtain's drawn\nThey're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\nBut when I do fall from these heights, though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nI've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\nIf I walked on water, I would drown\n\n'Cause I'm just a man but as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike\nSo me and you are not alike\nBitch, I wrote \"Stan\""

Can't believe it, now you're two\nBaby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you\nSit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (\nOkay!\n)\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem &\nKim\n]\nDon't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm about to do\nQuit crying, bitch! Why you always make me shout at you?\nHow could you just leave me and love him out the blue?\nOh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?\nToo bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!\nAt first I'm like, \"Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine\"\nBut not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?\nThis couch, this TV, this whole house is mine\nHow could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim\nLook at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him\nHe ain't so hot now, is he? Little punk\nWhy are you doing this? Shut the fuck up! You're drunk!\nYou're never gonna get away with this! You think I give a fuck?\nCome on! We're going for a ride, bitch! (\nNo!\n) Sit up front\nWe can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?\nWe'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk\n\nSo long, bitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\nSo long, bitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\n\nYou really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me\nNever knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me\nBut we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen\nThat was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean\nThat's fucked up! (I love you) I just—oh God, my brain is racin'\n(\nI love you\n) What are you doing? Change the station\nI hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (\nNo\n)\nThere's a **** year old little **** layin' dead with a slit throat in your livin' room\nHaha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?\nYou loved him, didn't you? (\nNo\n)\nBullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me\nWhat the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?\nFuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me\nKim? Kim! Why don't you like me?\nYou think I'm ugly, don't you? (\nIt's not—\n) No, you think I'm ugly\n(\nBaby\n) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me\nI hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you\nOh my God, I love you\nHow the fuck could you do this to me? (\nI'm sorry\n)\nHow the fuck could you do this to me?\n\nSo long\nBitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\nSo long\nBitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\n\nCome on, get out! I can't! I'm scared\nI said get out, bitch!\nLet go of my hair!\nPlease don't do this, baby! Please! I love you!\nLook, we can just take Hailie and leave!\nFuck you!\nYou did this to us! You did it! It's your fault\nOh my God, I'm crackin' up – get a grip, Marshall!\nHey, 'member the time we went to Brian's party\nAnd you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?\nThat was funny, wasn't it? Yes\nThat was funny, wasn't it? Yes\nSee, it all makes sense, doesn't it?\nYou and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife\nAnd during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (\nNo\n)\nAnd while this is going on, his son just woke up\nAnd he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut (\nOh my God\n)\nSo now they both dead and you slash your own throat (\nNo\n)\nSo now it's double homicide and suicide with no note\nI should've known better when you started to act weird\nWe could've—hey, where you going? Get back here\nYou can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else\nYou're only making this harder on yourself\nHaha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell\nHere, I'll scream with you: Ahh, somebody help!\nDon't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you\nNow shut the fuck up and get what's comin' to you\nYou were supposed to love me\nNow bleed, bitch, bleed!\nBleed, bitch, bleed!\nBleed!\n\nSo long\nBitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\nSo long\nBitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\n\n*Crickets, traffic, and trunk closing*"

It's fifteen degrees\nAnd it's Christmas Eve, \"Little prick, just leave!\"\nMa, let me grab my fucking coat!\nAnything to have each other's goats\nWhy we always at each other's throats?\nEspecially when Dad, he fucked us both\nWe're in the same fuckin' boat\nYou'd think that'd make us close (Nope)\nFurther away it drove us, but together, headlights shine\nAnd a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go\nBack to grandma's house, it's straight up the road\nAnd I was the man of the house, the oldest\nSo my shoulders carried the weight of the load\nThen Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old\nAnd that's when I realized you were sick\nAnd it wasn't fixable or changeable\nAnd to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but\n\nI guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night, I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far\n\n'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though\n'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow\nBut I'm sorry, Mama, for \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\"\nAt the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so\nNever meant that far to take it, though\n'Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes\nThat song I no longer play at shows\nAnd I cringe every time it's on the radio\nAnd I think of Nathan being placed in a home\nAnd all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own\nBut now the medication's takin' over\nAnd your mental state's deterioratin' slow\nAnd I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though\nBut, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo\nAll you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both\nFoster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours\nBut I love you, Debbie Mathers\nOh, what a tangled web we have 'cause\nOne thing I never asked was\nWhere the fuck my deadbeat dad was\nFuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address\nBut I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus\nOwned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas\nIf someone ever moved 'em from me, that you coulda bet your asses\nIf I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em\nAnd although one has only met their grandma once\nYou pulled up in our drive one night as we were leavin' to get some hamburgers\nMe, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you\nAnd as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness\nCome over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and\nI saw your headlights as I looked back and I'm mad I didn't get the chance to\nThank you for being my mom and my dad, so\nMom, please accept this as a tribute, I wrote this on the jet\nI guess I had to get this off my chest\nI hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead\nThe stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'\nSo, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message\nThat I will always love you from afar, 'cause you're my mom\n\nI guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night, I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far\n\n[Bridge: Nate Ruess &\nEminem\n]\nI want a new life (Start over)\nOne without a cause (Clean slate)\nSo I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)\nWell, no matter what the cost\nAnd if the plane goes down\nOr if the crew can't wake me up\nWell, just know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nOh, even if there's songs to sing\nWell, my children will carry me\nJust know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nBecause I put my faith in my little girls\nSo I'll never say goodbye cruel world\nJust know that I'm alright\nI am not afraid to die\n\nI guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night, I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far\nI want a new life"

    "lyrics": "When I was just a little baby boy\nMy mama used to tell me these crazy things\nShe used to tell me my daddy was an evil man\nShe used to tell me he hated me\nBut, then, I got a little bit older and I realized she was the crazy one\nBut there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change it\n'Cause that's just the way she was\n\nThey said I can't rap about bein' broke no more\nThey ain't say I can't rap about coke no more (Ah)\nSlut, you think I won't choke no whore?\n'Til the vocal cords won't work in her throat no more? (Ah)\nThese motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'\nThinkin' I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it (Ah)\nPut your hands down, bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you\nI'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you (Ah)\nShut up, slut! You're causin' too much chaos\nJust bend over and take it like a slut, okay, Ma?\n\"Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother\nAbusin' a whore, snortin' coke and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?\"\nYou goddamn right, bitch, and now it's too late\nI'm triple platinum, and tragedies happened in two states\nI invented violence, you vile venomous volatile vicious\nVain Vicodin, vrin, vrin, vrin\nTexas Chainsaw, left his brains all danglin' from his neck while his head barely hangs on\nBlood, guts, guns, cuts\nKnives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts\n\nBitch, I'ma kill you\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGirls neither\nYou ain't nothin' but a slut to me\nBitch, I'ma kill you\nYou ain't got the balls to beef\nWe ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef\nYou better kill me\nI'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said\nBut when they kill me\nI'm bringin' the world with me\nBitches too\nYou ain't nothin' but a girl to me (I said)\n\nYou don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, haha)\nI said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you\n\n(Bitch, I'ma kill you) like a murder weapon\nI'ma conceal you in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows, and film you\nFuck with me, I been through Hell, shut the hell up\nI'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em\nI ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid\nGot a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added\nWhoops, is that a subliminal hint? No\nJust criminal intent to sodomize women again\nEminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult\nAnd if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse\nTo do it again, then if he does it again\nYou'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (Ah)\nBitch, I'ma kill you\nI ain't done, this ain't the chorus\nI ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest\nA bloodstain is orange after you wash it\nThree or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?\nSerial killer hidin' murder material in a cereal box on top of your stereo\nHere we go again, we're out of our medicine\nOut of our minds and we want in yours, let us in\n\nOr I'ma kill you\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGirls neither\nYou ain't nothin' but a slut to me\nBitch, I'ma kill you\nYou ain't got the balls to beef\nWe ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef\nYou better kill me\nI'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said\nBut when they kill me\nI'm bringin' the world with me\nBitches too\nYou ain't nothin' but a girl to me (I said)\n\nYou don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Ah, haha)\nI said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Haha)\n\nKnow why I say these things?\n'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams\nAnd the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks\nThese eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece\nTwice, whatever, I hate these things\nFuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks\nMotherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows\nJust to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink\nFuck that\nI'll choke radio announcer to bouncer\nFrom fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her\nFrom principal to the student body and counselor\nFrom in-school to before-school or outta school\nI don't even believe in breathin'\nI'm leavin' air in your lungs just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it\nOkay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​\nI'm ready to make everyone's throats ache\nYou faggots keep eggin' me on 'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?\nShut up, give me your hands and feet\nI said shut up when I'm talkin' to you\nYou hear me? Answer me\n\nOr I'ma kill you\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGirls neither\nYou ain't nothin' but a slut to me\nBitch, I'ma kill you\nYou don't got the balls to beef\nWe ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef\nYou better kill me\nI'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said\nBut when they kill me\nI'm bringin' the world with me\nBitches too\nYou ain't nothin' but a girl to me\nBitch, I'ma kill you\n\nYou don't wanna fuck with Shady ('Cause why?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you (Haha)\nI said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (Why not?)\n'Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you\n\nHahaha\nI'm just playin', ladies\nYou know I love you"

Like I give a fuck, I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck\nThrough the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it\nLike G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up\nAnd if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut\nAnd I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook\nMe for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself\nWith a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt\n'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut\nI get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut\n'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust\nIt'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what\nGot me this far, picture me quittin'\nNow draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut\nIt's survival of what?\n\nThis is survival of the fittest\nThis is do or die\nThis is the winner takes it all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\n\n(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo\nBut don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle\nThis is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit\nLive, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this\nRefuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick\nI don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit\nAin't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do\nAs soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit\nBut my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do\n'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit\nSo there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade\nSo you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es\n'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me\nSo, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers\nBut I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve\n'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed\nAnd if you don't like me, then fuck you\nSelf-esteem must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me\nMy skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me\nI can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be\nAllergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it\nI just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve\n\nThis is survival of the fittest\nThis is do or die\nThis is the winner takes it all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"

You cut me deep as Caesarean\nYou know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious\nI want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman\nAfter the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him\nHis mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem\nThat's analogy and metaphor for you\nI should win a medal for all the ways I adore you\nThis is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'\nThat ain't what you like, ain't it?

Woke up in a dream state\nIn a cold sweat, like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave\nGuess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed\nDirectly aimin' a gat at my head\nWoke up again and jumped up, like, \"Fuck it, I've had it\nI'm checkin' into rehab,\" I confess I'm a static addict\nI guess that's why I'm so clingy\nEvery girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage\nOr I'm too fuckin' dramatic\nMan, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic\nI fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch, combative, possessive\nIn fact last time I was mad at an ex\nI actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events\nI said, \"Hit the road\", then after she left\nI sent that bitch a text that said, \"Be careful drivin'\nDon't read this and have an accident\"\nShe glanced to look at it and wrecked\nToo bad, thought we had a connect\nNo sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case\nThan the model covered in L'Oréal and mace\nWho fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'\nWhile the whore was yellin' \"rape\"\n'Til her vocal cords were swellin'\nAnd her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face\nStill they swarm the gates of my fancy estates\nTo greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace\n'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date\nDon't be late, well, the sentiment's great\nBut wait, think there's been a mistake\nYou wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate\nI have infinite hate in my blood\nIt's mainly 'cause of the game of\nWait, \"dinner at eight\"?\nI have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly 'cause of the\n\nGame of\nlove,\nlove,\nlove,\nlove\nLa-la-la-la-la-love"

Am I a martian?\nWhat kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?\n‘Cause I don't belong in this world\nThat's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often\nFlyin' off at the handle at my mom\nNo dad, so I am noncompliant at home\nAt school I'm just shy and awkward\nAnd I don't need no goddamn psychologist\nTryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems\nThinkin' he can try and solve 'em\nI'm outside chalkin' up drawings\nOn the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'\nTo myself, either that or inside hidin' off in\nThe corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to\nBe noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'\nI had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'\nSome cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker\n‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Polina & (\nEminem\n)]\nAnd if you fall, I'll get you there\nI'll be your savior from (\nYeah\n) all the wars\nThat are fought inside your world\nPlease have faith in my words\n\n‘Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy\n\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'\nWhy am I so differently wired in my noggin?\n‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'\n‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit\nBothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara\nThen split, but I don’t give a shit\nI'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman\nNothing is the matter with me\nShit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'\nI bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment\nComplex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that\nI find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it\nHeadphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit\nBut if this is all there is for me life offers\nWhy bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense\nBut I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience\nWhat about them rhymes I've been jottin'?\nThey are kind of giving me confidence\nInstead of tryin' to escape through my comics\nWhy don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?\nTo put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that\nSay what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him\nGrab hold of my balls, like, \"That's right, fight's on, bitch!\"\nWho woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that\nI could be iconic in my conquest?\nThat's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest\n\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy\n\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'\nNow I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome\n‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this\nAnd connect lines like crosswords\nAnd use my enemy's words as strength\nTo try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em\n‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit\nBy you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit\nNow you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'\nThought I was full of horseshit\nAnd now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'\nMe against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins\nVersus the whole 0-16 Lions offense\nSo bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins\nIt's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins\n‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers\nYou're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical\nWith this dialogue since '99 Rawkus\nYou don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can\nSuck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass\nIn a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage\nThe most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'\n'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes\nThe best part about me is I am not you\nI'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my—\n\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThis is my legacy, legacy, yeah\nThere's no guarantee\nIt's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy"

Nah, courageous balls, had to change my style\nThey said I'm way too soft and I sound like AZ and Nas\nOut came the claws and the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\" I pondered, I just wanna play my part\nShould I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on\nAnd I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the art form I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\nAnd keep plugging, it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it—, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a ka-billion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my\nStory, bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are\nWhen I was afraid to—\n\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (\nMy dreams\n)\nI didn't wanna go another round (\nYeah\n)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (\nAgh\n)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (\nYeah\n)\n\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear\n\nFeels like a close, it's comin' to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I—, thing I know\n\nI know what it was like, I was there once\nSingle parents, hate your appearance\nDid you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on, that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped sayin' I gave a fuck\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park? (Oh)\nAnd the window is closin'\nAnd there's nowhere else that I can go with flows, and I'm frozen\n'Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo, to the break of dawn, here I go recyclin' the same old song\nBut I'd rather make Not Afraid two than make another motherfuckin' \"We Made You\", ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on\nI gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania\nSo when they empty that stadium\nLeast I made it out of that house and found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just gettin' accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say, don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk, take it with a grain of salt\nAnd eat their fuckin' faces off (Haha)\nThe legend of the angry blond lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a—\n\nI was a—, afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out, out, out\nAfraid I'd never be found (\nMy dreams\n)\nI didn't wanna go another round (\nYeah\n)\nAn angry man's power will shut you up (\nAgh\n)\nAnd trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run (\nYeah\n)\n\nGuts over fear (The time is near)\nGuts over fear (Might shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me around\nI let you keep me down (Now, I got)\nGuts over fear, guts over fear"

I love you\nI never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)\nWill someone please explain to my brain\nThat I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?\nI take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts\n'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I\nSo when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass\nThen it probably is obvious I got it on with her\n'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with\nI bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it\n\nI came to the club drunk with a fake ID\nDon't you wanna grow up to be just like me?\nI've been with ten women who got HIV\nNow don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?\nI got genital warts and it burns when I pee\nDon't you wanna grow up to be just like me?\nI tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree\nYou probably wanna grow up to be just like me"

to use my motherfuckin' trailer to tease me with\nBut I flipped that script like a refill of\nPainkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal (Ha)\nIt made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery\nAnd if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script\nAin't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio—eat a dick\nI still never ABC this shit\nMainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller\nSince before they called Jay Dee \"Dilla\"\nI was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit\nAnd if I ever end up escapin' these streets\nI swear that I would stay here still\nAnd if I'm crazy, I'll always be real (Ah)\nDon't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler\nBreak all of my friends out of here\nAnd take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer\nPeel off back to the same block that we came from\nOn a rampage too crazy for me to flip\nWhat's makin' you think I need a switch?\n'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson when he's ragin' and heated and\nOn the way to go beat his kid?\nOn a track get spanked like he just did\n(Detroit) I can't never leave this bitch\nSick of bein' treated like we ain't shit\nBut Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me\nTo do features and them cyphers on BET, 'cause if\nI wasn't me I prob'ly wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit\nSeems to be reachin' its fever pitch\nHundred and eighty degrees in here (Hah)\nShoulder blade full of cedar chips\nMCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish\nOr Lorena with two penises\nHateful and geniusness inconvenience\nAnd for the record, you don't want this type of static\nIn your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it\nMay consider tryna reinsulate your windows\nMay be in for another crazy winter\n‘Cause so cold in the D, it is\nAs days begin to tick away, but ain't this really\nWhat made me into the angry bitter blonde?\nBut ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?\nDon't make me unleash this shit, release this pit (Hah)\nMay even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit\nOr maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit\nIs playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'\nIt's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer\nSince the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter\nWith a potato peeler\nAnd mushed her face into the entertainment center (Hah)\nIt's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again\nOr the Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent\nAwaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger\nDid you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here?\nAnd if they mention us\n\nTell 'em, if they want it, they can come get that (Static)\nI swear I love my city, I just want less (Static)\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (Static)\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\nWhat up though? It's the godfather Trick Trick\nYou either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on\nThat means Detroit vs. Everybody\nHey, Em, let me get that instrumental, take it down to the hood\nLet the little homies get this remix crackin'\nDetroit\nOkay"

'Cause you're a...\n\nWhite boy, white boy, you're a rockstar\nMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live\nWhite boy, white boy, in your cop car\nBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve\nWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchable\nThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care\nNobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a\nbig rockstar\n\nBlack boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and\nWe don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man\nDon't tell us your attitude's a result of that\nBalderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?\nWhy you kicking that soda can?\nPull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and\nThrow your ass in the van cuffed\nYou don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are\nOur cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands\nAnd put our minds more at ease\nOr get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy\nWe're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine\nTryna clean up the streets from all these minorities\nThat's what we call 'em pigsties for\nThey're like eyesores to police\nTalk to you like you're just a piece of trash\nFeels like we're stuck in a time warp to me\nAs I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions\nAs this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in\nTo the sixties, having black skin is risky\n'Cause this keeps happening\nThroughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit\nAnd I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...\n\nWhite boy, white boy, you're a rockstar\nMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live\nWhite boy, white boy, in your cop car\nBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve\nWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchable\nThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care\nNobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a\nbig rockstar\n\nSeems like the average lifespan of a white man\nIs more than twice than a black life span\nI wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner\nI feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance\nI'd rather hear 'em say \"Die, N-word\" than Die Antwoord\nNinja, now it's better disguised banter\nBut that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially\nAnd can't find answers\nWe're applying, but McDonald's\nSeems to be the only franchise that'll hire\nSo how can we have higher standards?\nAs Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter\nWe fight back with violence but acts like that are\nBlack eyes on the movement\nWhich makes black lives madder\nAt cops and cops madder\nThat's why it's at a stalemate\nAnd can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops\nI wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops\nThe block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot\nCall the attack dogs off of us, man\nYou always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop\nAnd bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop\nSendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods\nWho ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it\nWho seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns\nAnd know nobody black so they act afraid of us\nAnd that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em\nA subconscious racist\nWait, why are there black neighborhoods?\n'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area\nSeparated us, Section-Eight'd us\nWhen we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us\nAnd education sucks, and every day's another\nFreddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz\nWhy is it they treat us like dryer lint?\nWe just want a safe environment for our kids\nBut can't escape the sirens\nDon't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in\nThe poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in\nThe lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence\nAnd we're trapped in these racial biases\nThat plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise\nEvery time we see a devil's face\nLions, tigers, and bears, oh my\nIt's more like billy clubs and gats\nAnd we really love it when you think we're guilty ‘cause we're black\n\"But you kill each other, facts\nYou peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats”\nSingle mother strugglin' through substance abuse\nWhile people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes\nFuck your Republican views\nPull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?\nAnd streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics\nOr be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black\nYou better be strapped with a derringer\nOr be “capped in America” like Steve Rogers\n'Cause no one oversees these cops and\nAll we see is 'em beat charges\nWe done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off\nSo we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings\nJust keep marchin', 'til we reach congress\nBut they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance\nIf you try to slander the flag but\nSomebody has to be the sacrificial lamb\nSo they call it a Kaepernick tantrum\nIf you don't stand for the national anthem\nWe raise it, you better praise it\nOr you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll\nTreat you like Rodney Dangerfield\nHome of the brave is still racist 'ville\nSo this whole nation feels like a plantation field\nIn a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals\nThat had its Natives killed\nGot you singin' this star-spangled spiel\nTo a piece of cloth that represents the \"Land of the Free\" that made people slaves to build"

    "lyrics": "I can feel the heat risin'\nEverything is on fire\nToday's a painful reminder of why\nIt can only get brighter (Brighter)\nThe further you put it behind ya (Behind ya)\nBut right now I'm on the inside\nLookin' out, 'cause\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nYesterday was the tornado warnin', today's like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the mournin' process\nAnd rebuilding, you're still a work in progress\nToday's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma, ugh\nThunderstorm has passed ya\nYou weathered it and poked its eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed\nSo focused on the bright side, then you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back\nMay hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to\nTo avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage\n'Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nYou're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like\nIt happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive, which means you will survive\nAlthough today you may weep 'cause you're weak and\nEverything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'\nIt begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'\nYou from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end\nAnd I'm pullin' for you to push through this feelin'\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing\nAnd by tomorrow, you may even feel so good that you're willin' to forgive 'em\nEven after all the shit you've been put through, this feelin' of resilience is buildin'\nAnd the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this buildin'\nYou're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, 'cause you're so over 'em\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\nAs time passes, things change every day\nBut wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same\nBut tomorrow, today's going down in flames\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet\nAs you barely even perspire from the heat\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\nIt's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\nBut you've extinguished this livin' hell\nStill, a little piece of you dies as you scream\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nI feel the burn\nWatch the smoke as I turn, rising\nA phoenix from the flames\nI have learned\nFrom fighting fights that weren't mine\nIt's not with fists\nBut with wings that I will fly\n\nAnd I'm standin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nTo find the light, find the light, find the light\nStandin' in the flames\nAnd it's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light"

Screw Dre?\nYou went there lookin' for me? Boo, that excuse is too lame\nKeep playin' me, you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg\nYou fake, lyin' slut, you never told me you knew Drake\nAnd Lupe? You wanna lose two legs?\nYou tryin' to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you, you say\n\"Okay, yeah, and I'm coo-coo, eh?\" — Well, screw you\nAnd I'll be the third person who screwed you today\nOh, fourth—Dre, Drake, Lupe—ooh, touché\nYou were too two-faced for me\nThought you was my number one true-blue ace\nBut you ain't and I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face\n'Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo, you make my fuckin' Bluetooth ache\nYou're feeling blue? Too late, go smurf yourself\nYou make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid\nHere's what you say to someone you hate\n\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead?\nI would feel so much, much better (better, better)\n\nThink I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink\nHop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think\n'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em\nI'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink\nI'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes\nBut bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!\nExcuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm\nChannelin' my anger through every single station that's on!\n'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, \"he-art\"\n'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage\nWho do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off\nAnd pick myself up off the carpet\nBut I'll never say the L-word again\nI lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!\nAaahhh! I hope you hear this song\nAnd go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—\n\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead?\nI would feel so much, much better\n\n'Cause you told me\nYou'd love me\nForever\nBitch, that was a lie\nNow I never\nWanted someone to die\nSo bad in my fuckin' life\nBut fuck it, there’s other fish in the sea\n\nAnd I'ma have a whale of a time\nBein' a single sailor for the night, bitch, on a scale of\nOne to ten, shit, I must be the Holy Grail of\nCatches, ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fuckin' name (De La)\nI might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made\nFor me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her\nThese bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of\nMy bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer\nLike I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch\nBut bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch\nBitch, you complain when you listen to this\nBut you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch\nThat's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site\nLong as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike\nSo all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid\nI avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed\nOye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boys\nGettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink\nYou fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink\nI got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one\nShe's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun\nI'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song\nAnd go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just\nDrop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes\n\nMy life would be so much better\nIf you just dropped dead (I hate you)\nI was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'\nAnd then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)\nAnd I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier\nIf you dropped dead?

the night before\nIf you think you're promised tomorrow (Yeah)\nNow I'm 'bout to fool again\nThis tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit\nA freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip\nAnd I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick\nIf I was you, I wouldn't do nothin' stupid due to the mood I'm in\nI'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint\nShow me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed\nEmpty the lubricant and put super glue in it (Woo)\nHow many fuckin' rappers did I go through?\nDispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked\nAnd you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit\nBut am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?\n'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now\nWell, I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down\nBut the only way I care is if I let myself down\nBut what the fuck have I woke to?\nTime to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools\nI know you still want me to ill out, don't you?\nHopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open\nFire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you\nSo chill out, no, you\nHoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you\nThen I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you\nYou just called my shit trash?\nThank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked\n\"\nRevival\n's wack, I don't like the 'Zombie' track\nAnd when he's talkin' that garbage psychotic crap\nWhere's your content at?\nWhat's with all the conscious rap?\nP!nk, Beyoncé this and Kehlani that\" (Yeah)\nI just add it to the fuel in my rocket pack\n'Til I'm ready to respond, then I'ma launch it at 'em\nIdiotic from the fuckin' embryonic sac\nTo the body bag, I'll be back\nAnd when I am, I'll be at your fuckin' throat like—\n\nLike Chloraseptic"

    "lyrics": "Take me to the river\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nIt's 2002, everything was totally new\nWe were globally huge, watchin' sales go through the roof\nWe wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\nA multitude of homies who would pounce for no good excuse\nWe were so bulletproof, wrote, souped, and soaked in our youth\nThought we was runnin' shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do\nAnd at the time I was goin' through my own struggles too\nSo I wasn't in no condition to be coachin' us through\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\nI was hopin' they do, so I ain't have to shoulder the crew\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\nHow to stand on their own, and I don't wanna open up wounds\nI just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\n'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\nShoot\n\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown\n\nto the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nIt was never the same and it's bothered me since\nAnd the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\nPlus we don't say how we feel\nAnd I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we're in\nBeen with you guys thick and thin\nBut it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends\nWhich reminded me, Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\nY'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\nIf you'da put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\nMore to try talkin' you into comin' up off it\nI know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is\nI think of all of the trips to BET\nAnd the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\nMaybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features\nBut that's water under the bridge\nBut I'm washin' my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed\n\nIf I could leave this all behind\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\nDown\n\nto the river with you\nHelp me leave this all behind\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nBacardi and Hen', never thought the party would end\nOne minute you're bodyin' shit, but then your audience splits\nYou can already sense the climate is starting to shift\nTo these kids you no longer exist\nWent from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch\nTo tiny drops, little drips\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed\nYou start thinkin' of all the artists you dissed\nAll the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\nFor turnin' your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva, and Swift?\nA Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\nI ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment\nBut it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none\nI just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\nTo my partners, I can't say how sorry I am\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\nI love all of you men\nBut I just can't be the guy everybody depends\nOn for entire careers 'cause that's not even fair\nI will always be here, but that spark isn't there\nAnd I don't know how to recapture that time and that era\nI've tried hearkening back to, but I'm fightin' for air\nI'm barely chartin' myself\nFeels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent\nTo treat y'all like a stepping stone\nThough I ain't left no one behind, but we been down every road\nDone all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\nBut the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live\nThe less is left for closure, so let's let this go\nIt's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\n\nI'ma wash away my sins\nI'ma rinse away this dirt\nI forgot to make amends\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\nI better stop and say my grace\nFrom it I pray that I don't fall\n'Cause on the way back down I may\nEnd up runnin' back into them all\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\n\nI never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones\nI never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"

Come and get some, boys!\nI'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course\nOn excessive force and pressure points\nAnd dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange\nDress and four inch heels to address the court\nWith a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso\nAre left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him\n\nIn my present form I'm Desert Storm\nAppetite for destruction there's no suppressant for\nAggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel\nUnpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!\nThe rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus\nMet a contortionist, said, \"When you wanna get sexual?\"\nShe said, \"However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible.\"\nExpired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach\nIn the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on\nAt a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph\nFor this asshole cop's daughter\nLaugh 'cause I called her a brat on it\nHe spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock\nHad a heart attack and dropped dead\nStarted fallin' back with it\nAnd got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock\n\nOne ball and half a dick, Apple Watch\nCrack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel\nKnocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*\nAsked if they had a laugh in stock\nThat was fuckin' stupid…\n\nYou got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch\nA doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic\nBitch, get to massagin' this dick!\nLike spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick\nGot a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with\nThere's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with\nShe's non-existent\nRobin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit\nBut I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches\nMisfit, blond and nitwit\nLike I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit\nScreamed, \"I hate blondes,\" and became one, I'm optimistic\nLove to start shit\nShovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment\nOf the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx\nI'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser\nShadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across\nOlympic gymnast, been known for some assaults\nA couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer\nSame damn brain scan results as Rainman's is\nSomething's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's\nDressin' up in your mummy costume\nOn stage dancin' to \"Brain Damage,\" what's the problem?\nNothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status\nRun the faucet, I'ma dunk\nA bunch of Trump supporters underwater\nSnuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan\nIt's a wrap, like an ACE bandage\nDon't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand\nE&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand\nShe wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan\nThree-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say\nConsider me a dangerous man\nBut you should be afraid of this dang candidate\nYou say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet\n'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'\nAnd that's what you wanted\nA fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button\nWho doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!\n\nIf I was president, gettin' off is\nThe first order of business, once I get in office\nSecond thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam\nNaked, laughin', dick cupped in hand\nScreamin', \"Fuck safe sex!\"\nThrow a latex and an AIDS test at him\nTell Congress I run this land\nAnd I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy\nAddiction to friction and static\nAddict who can't escape the habit\nContinue to chase the dragon\nBut as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics\nDressed as the maintenance man\nIn a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket\nWith a gauge to blast it\nAnd sped away in the station wagon\nStacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's\nCrazy asses in the backseat\nThrowin' Stayfree pads at me\nDead passenger in the passenger seat\nUnfasten the safety latches\nAnd slam on the brakes in traffic so hard\nI snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires\n'Finna get a murder case and catch it\nLike you threw it at me encased in plastic\n\nAnd send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz\nUntil he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...\nLike a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'\nAnd skids 'til he hits a cement pillar\nSwing for the fence like Prince Fielder\nKnock it into the upper peninsula\nYou wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God\nWhen will I quit? Never been realer\nThe in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt\nWhose pen's iller than Prince in a chinchilla\nOr Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller\nRevenge killer, avenge syllable binge\nFill a syringe, 'til I\nDraw first blood\nEven pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular\nCouldn't be more awkwarder\n'Cause your innocence I robbed you of\nIt's my fingers that got stuck up\nTaught ya ta not give a\nSlapstick, hockey puck\nThe broad hunter with the sawed off\nLike an arm when it's lopped off of ya\nBut I'm not gonna get the shotgun\nOr Glock, I'ma opt for the ox\nCause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop\nAnd it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker\nThe Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought\nThis much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter\nThat was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned\nI'm unravelin' quickly\nMy squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me\nTry and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey\nTip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles\nLike what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column\nThat's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems\nWish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em\nBut the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles\nAnd why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is\nMore of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel\nBut my patience is wearing thin\nSwear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in\nDiss you in every lyric until you fear the pen\nAnd never appear again\nIf you actually had fuckin' careers to end\nBut then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them\nMolly, I'm gone off you\nMan, light some kush\nYou're my first take, I'll nail you\nCan't lie, I gush\nIf I won you over, you would be the grand prize\nI'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push\nYou can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch\nJeans too small, least three pant sizes tush\nMushed against your damn side, your puss\nAnd thighs are squished\nWhat kind of attire's that?\nI'm ready to be rode\nPsychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat\nLight the match to ignite the wrath\nGot knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves\nPiper Chapmans might just have to picket me\nLike a scab\nHard to describe in fact\nStartling violent perhaps\nAre things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that\nAnd you aren't really surprised at that\nBut as far as these lines I rap\nAnd these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track\n\nWhy am I such a dick?"

I'm somehow now back to the underdog\nBut no matter how loud that I bark\nThis sport is somethin' I never bow-out at\nI complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate\nBut I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt\nEven when you bitches are countin' me out\nAnd I appear to be down for the count\nOnly time I ever been out and about\nIs drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt\n'Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here\nBut I'm not a quitter, gotta get up, give it all I got or give up\nSpit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'\nI'm tryna be headstrong\nBut it feels like I slept on my neck wrong\n'Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?\n'Cause someone told me that\n\nKings never die\n\nDon't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir\nYou ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep\nNobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer\nWouldn't even take shit into consideration\nObliterate anyone in the way\nI think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features\nAnd try to show out on a track with me\nBut it'd actually have to be\nA fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire\nTell these new artists that kings never die\nI know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page\nDid it just say I've been upstaged?\nWhy am I online? It's driving me crazy\nI'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge\nOn what's hot, but I'm not one to conform\nBut as days pass in this shit\nAnd opinions sway, I can hear 'em say\nIf I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous\nComeback, as if I went away\nBut detractors just say so much for the renegade\nSomeone's gonna make me blow my composure\nHere I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage\nThey so want a champion to fall\nIt's no wonder why I laugh at 'em\n'Cause why can't we win 'em all?\nSo fuck what these cynics say\nIt just goes to show that when my back's against the wall\nAnd I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed to\nWith this pent-up rage, 'cause all these plaques in my office\nOn the floor stacked against the door\nAre they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?\n'Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards\nAnd trophies just don't mean jack anymore\nIf I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be\n\nHere to stay\nEven when I'm gone\nWhen I close my eyes\nThrough the passage of time\nKings never die\n\nI want it, I'm comin' to get it\nSo you son of a bitches don't duck\nYou’re gonna get Riddick Bowe'd\nCritics'll end up in critical\nThink your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked\nAnd I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again\nAll alone and on a throne, like a token of respect\nOr a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed\nTossed in the air by my own arm\nAnd launched so hard it broke my collarbone\nAnd when it's my time to go\nI'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know\nBut I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya\nKnock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, 'cause\n\nThey say kings never die\nJust ask Jam Master Jay\nThey just grow wings and they fly\nSo, hands up, reach for the sky\nTry to hold on and prolong these moments\n'Cause in a blink of an eye\nThey'll be over\n\nSo you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur\nAnd ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were\nSo before you're leavin' this Earth\nYou want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk\nDeacon of words, syllable genius at work\nPlus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness\nI went from powdered milk and Farina\nTo flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts\nAt Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas\nStill appeal to the dreamers\nI made it to the silverscreen\nBut Rocky's still what the theme is\nKhalil on the beat, 'cause makin' the beat\nAin't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is\nOr fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is\nIt's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl\nCommon, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz\nStomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone\nGod, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down\nI'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground\nYou ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…\n\nHere to stay\nEven when I'm gone\nWhen I close my eyes\nThrough the passage of time\nKings never die\nKings never die"

I thought you said it was your tummy\"\n\"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee\"\n\"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over\nAnd just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework\"\n\"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?\"\n\"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him\"\n\nBrain damage, ever since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was goin'\nBut everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song\nBrain damage, ever since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was goin'\nBut everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song\nBrain damage\n\nWay before my baby daughter Hailie\nI was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey\nAn eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes\nSo every day he'd shove me in the lockers\nOne day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'\nAnd had me in the position to beat me into submission\nHe banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose\nSoaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat\nI tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef\nBut he just wouldn't leave\nHe kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe\nHe looked at me and said, \"You gonna die, honky\"\nThe principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me\n(\nWhat's going on in here?\n)\nI made 'em think they beat me to death\nHoldin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left\nThen I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth\nKicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws\nGrabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools\nThis is for every time you took my orange juice\nOr stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk\nEvery time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt\nI'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good\nI cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could\nAnd beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood\nKnocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot\nMade it home later that same day\nStarted readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray\nI couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read\nI went deaf and my left ear started to bleed\nMy mother started screamin', \"What are you on, drugs?!\nLook at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug\" (I'm sorry)\nShe beat me over the head with the remote control\nOpened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull\nI picked it up and screamed, \"Look, bitch, what have you done?\"\n\"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son\"\nShut up, you cunt\nI said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head\nThen I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck\n\nBrain damage, ever since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was goin'\nBut everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song\nBrain damage, ever since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was goin'\nBut everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song\n\nBrain damage, it's brain damage\nI got brain damage, it's brain damage\nIt's probably brain damage, it's brain damage\nBrain damage, I got brain damage"

Where am I?\nMan, fuck, am I hungover? And, goddamn, I\nGot a headache, shit, half a Vicodin? Why can't I?\nAll systems ready for take off, please, stand by\n\nSometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know\nFeels like I been down this road before\nSo lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me\nAs soon as I go home and close the door\nKinda feels like déjà vu\nI wanna get away from this place, I do\nBut I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie\n'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know\n\nSo I take a Vicodin, splash, it hits my stomach, then (Ah)\nCouple of weeks go by, it ain't even like I'm gettin' high\nNow I need it just not to feel sick, yeah, I'm gettin' by\nWouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die\nOh yeah, there's an excuse; you lose Proof, so you use\nThere's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through\nIt's twelve-noon, ain't no harm in self-inducin' a snooze\nWhat else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?\nNow here I am three months later, full-blown relapse\n\"Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax\"\nAnd since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac\nI need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps\nJust to be able to function throughout the day, let's see\nThat's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?\nAnd that will average out to about one good hour's sleep\nOkay, so now ya see the reason how come he\nHas taken four years to just put out an album, B\nSee, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath\n'Cause that Christmas, you know the whole pneumonia thing?\nIt was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?\nOr the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?\nYour VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR\nGreat places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie\n\"I'm going beddy-bye, Whitney, baby; good night, Alaina\"\nGo in the room and shut the bedroom door\nAnd wake up in an ambulance, they said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn\n\nSometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know\nFeels like I been down this road before\nSo lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me\nAs soon as I go home and close the door\nKinda feels like déjà vu\nI wanna get away from this place, I do\nBut I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie\n'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know"

Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!\"\nI'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's\nSloppy Joe's, bulk waffles\nGot caught pickin' my nose (Agh!)\nLook over, see these two hot hoes\nFinger still up one of my nostrils\nRight next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's\nTakin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it\nRubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'\nPlay it off, \"What you bumpin'?\"\n\"\nTrunk Muzik\n, Yelawolf's better,\" fuckin' bitch!\nThey want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it\nThe pressure, they want me to follow up with\nAnother one, after\nRecovery\nwas so highly coveted\nBut what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?\n'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip\nHoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches\nWrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch\nQuit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids\nI love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!\nThe shit I complain about\nIt's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out\nKool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out\nBut bitch, I got an elevator in my house\nAnts and a mouse—I'm livin' the dream!\n\nMaybe that's why I feel so strange\nGot it all, but I still won't change\nMaybe that's why I can't leave Detroit\nIt's the motivation that keeps me goin'\nThis is the inspiration I need\nI could never turn my back on a city that made me\nAnd (Life's been good to me so far)"

Now\n\nI'm leaving Heaven\nI'm leaving Heaven\nAngels won't find me\nWhere I am going\n\nI've been down, kicked\nLike around six thousand times since I was a kid\nAs a child, picked on, clowned, been\nCountless times I've been outed\nGotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)\nSo the route I went's self-empowerment\nIn a hole, taught myself how to get out of it\nAnd balance it with talents, wit\n'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)\n'Cause it's only one percent\nWho overcome the shit they've underwent\nI went AWOL like what my back was up against\nDon't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it\nI was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked\nMalcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle\nAnd I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah\nBut I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment\nBesides getting it from both sides of the tracks\nBut I swore I'd get them back\nEven if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)\nThought of a scheme and it got me to thinking\nIf I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it\nThat's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink\nAnd as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em\nA God with a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even\nLike I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end\nThis evil is calling, I'm already seething and\n\nI'm leaving Heaven\nI'm leaving Heaven\nAngels won't find me\nWhere I am going\n\nOkay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)\nI was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)\nLooking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)\nFlippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see\nIf I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat\nIf Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece\nTwenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips\nWe'd be glad to get that even if we had to split\nWe'd do backward flips, looking back at it\nI think that would fit with the definition of not having shit\nCouple that with the fact my mother was batshit\nPop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit\nYeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had\nSince a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab\nJust to hear them words, ear piercing\nLike my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring\nShould I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died\nMe? Tear no shed\nShould I have made a mural at your funeral?\nHad your coffin draped with a hero's flag?\nWhere the fuck you were at\nWhen De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?\nNever met your grandkids, fucking coward\nOnly guts you had was from your stomach fat\nI couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven\nSo I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell\nSo I can whip your fucking ass\nI hate that I'll never get to say \"I hate you\" to your face\nNo coming back from where I'm going\nSky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel\nDig with the blade of it then I step on the metal\nVendetta to settle, tell the Devil\n\nI'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)\nI'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)\nAngels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)\nWhere I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)\nI'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)\nI'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I'da had you)\nAngels won't find me (\nI wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you\n)\nWhere I am going (\nOr maybe I should say, \"Thank you\"\n)\n(\n'Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha\n)\n\nSo you better, you better run (Yeah)\nYou better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)\nYou better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)\nYou better, you better run (See you in Hell)"

'Cause it's getting expensive\nBeing on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive\nThey say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lengths this\nFar at other people's expenses\nI say you're all just too goddamn sensitive\nIt's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous\nLet's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this\nAnd Chris-stiff-er Reeves won't sit for this neither\nAnd let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either\nHe used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I\nHad one of those 25-cent stickers on my refrigerator\nRight next to Darth Vader\nAnd Darth must've put a hex on him for later\nI feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that—\nI stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor\nI killed Superman, I killed Super—\nMan, and how ironic\nThat I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic\n\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is—\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is... Rain Man\n\nNow in the Bible, it says:\n\"Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed\nHave homosexual sex\nUnless, of course, you were given the consent to join in\nThen, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex\nWhich isn't as bad, long as you show some remorse for your actions\nEither before, during, or after performing the act of that which\nIs normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases\nThat are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way\nBut who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?\"\nLet's ask Dr. Dre—Dr. Dre? (\nWhat up?\n)\nI got a question, if I may (\nYeah\n)\nIs it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (\nYeah\n)\nAnd watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (\nYeah\n)\nBut, —ut, I ain't done yet\nIn football, the quarterback yells out, \"Hut-hut\"\nWhile he reaches in another grown man's ass\nGrabs on his nuts, but, just, what if\nIt was never meant—it was just an accident\nBut he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—\nHis teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it\nBut his little weenie flinched just a little bit?\nAnd I don't need to go into any more details, but—\nWhat if he pictured it as a female's butt? Is that gay?\nI just need to clear things up\n'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because\n\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became\nWith this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is... Rain Man\n\nYou find me offensive, I find you offensive—\nShit, this is the same verse, I just did this\nWhen am I gonna come to my good senses?\nProbably the day Bush comes to my defenses\nMy spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby\nAnd my plan is to get him next and open up a whip-ass canister\nGod damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (\nYeah\n)\nAnyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it\nThis is the only thing that I'm good at\nI am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic\nDemonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it\nI got it, high-five Nick Lachey\nStuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)\nAnd as she flew around the room like a balloon\nI grabbed the last can of chicken-tuna out the trash can, and zoom\nI headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch\nWith a peanut butter–jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich\nAnd I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense\nI just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit\n\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became\nWith this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is... Rain Man\n\n'Cause ah, uh, ah, eh, ugh...\nYup\nRain Man\nDefinitely, definitely Dr. Dre\nSuper-dope beatmaker\n2000 and 1000, four-hundred-and-eighty-seven-million-nine-hundred-and-se—seventy-three-thousand-four-hundred-and-sixty-three...\nAnd seventy\nYeah"
