Take my hand
Take my whole life, too

The prison band was there, they began to wail
The band was jumping, and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those locked-out jailbirds sing

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowing on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Number forty-seven said to number three:
""You’re the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Rock, rock, rock

Sad Sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair""

Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty, and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks.""

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'

In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto (
In the ghetto

A-people, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man someday
A-take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

Then one night, in desperation
The young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far

And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Facedown on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto (
In the ghetto
)
And as her young man dies (
In the ghetto
)
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)

And his mama cries

Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?

Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage, and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare, and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain? Shall I come back again?
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight?"

But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exception

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh, no, no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the words he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
The record shows I took the blows

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Loving you, just loving you
Winter, summer, springtime, too
Loving you, loving you
Makes no difference where I go or what I may do
You know that I'll always be loving you, just you and

If I'm seen with someone new
Don't be blue, don't you be blue
I'll be faithful, I'll be true
Always true, true to you
There is only one for me, and you know who
You know that I'll always be loving you"

A soft-hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh

Now Adam told to Eve
""Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree""

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man

Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
""Keep your cotton-picking fingers
Out my curly hair""

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh

I heard about a king
Who was doin' swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock

Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Ever since the world began, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man, uh-huh"

You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed, but you
And now you've gone away

But don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me
Believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe me, I'll never tie you down

Left alone just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, oh believe me

Oh, you don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me, oh believe me"

Even through the valleys too
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing

I just had to reach you, baby
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelling night and day
I kept running all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
Baby, trying to get to you

Well, there's nothing that could hold me
Or could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true

Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you"

Consider all the worlds thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

(When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation)
(And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart)
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great thou art

Then sings my soul my savior God to thee
How great thou art (how great thou art)
How great thou art (how great thou art)
Then sings my soul my savior God to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art"
