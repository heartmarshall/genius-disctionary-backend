bitch\nMatter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this\nDo the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists\nAnd my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit\nArguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit\nI heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane\nChi nigga, but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said, \"This the number to dial\nIf you wanna make your number one your number two now\"\nMix that Goose and Malibu, I call it \"Malibooyah\"\nGoddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style\nKnow that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?\nWhatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now\nKnow I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now\nThink you motherfuckers

scream in my dreams\nMurder, murder in black convertibles, I\nKill a block, I murder the avenues, I\nRape and pillage your village, women and children\nEverybody want to know what my Achilles heel is\nLove, I don't get enough of it\nAll I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers\nAll I see is these niggas I made millionaires\nMillin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air\nAll I see is these fake fucks with no fangs\nTryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins\nI smell a massacre\nSeems to be the only way to back you bastards up\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop

rocking gold teeth and fangs\n'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do\nHair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do\nMonster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe\nYoung Money is the roster and a monster crew\nAnd I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face\nAnd if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't\nSo let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?\nBut my features and my shows ten times your pay?\n50K for a verse, no album out\nYeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it\nHotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent\nTony Matterhorn,

Got a bald fade, I might slam\nPink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam\nThank God for me (\nLos Angeles\n)\nWhole family gettin' money, thank God for E\nI love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful\nBitches say he funny and disrespectful\nI feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes\nI feel like Pablo when I see me on the news\nI feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house\nTell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out\nWe need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots\nDrop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop\nShe brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that\nShe keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that\nShe push me back when the dick go too deep\nThis good dick'll put your ass to sleep\nGet money (Money, money, money)\nBig, big money (Money, money, money)\nAnd as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em\nEven the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker\n\n[Bridge: Larry Graham]\nI just keep on lovin' you, baby\nAnd there's no one else I know can take your pla—, pla—, pla—\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West, \nJunie Morrison\n & \nGhostface Killah\n]\nPlease, no more parties in L.A.

    "lyrics": "[Intro: Kanye West]\nYeah, yeah\n9:08 L.A. time\nBack in the lab and shit\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nMy wife said I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\n'Specially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said, \"He's way out of control\"\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI could see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated, so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-five\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you're wonderin' where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky (Father, Father, Father)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi (In the night sky, yeah)\nI feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (\nReal\n)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know You got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire, then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like Where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with an off-the-wall flow\n\n[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas, oh, anywhere, everything but in between\nOh, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you're wonderin' where where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky (Father, Father, Father)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi (In the night sky)\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky (Father, Father, Father)\nAnd you're wonderin' where is God in your nightlife (In the night sky)\n\n[Verse 3: Sampha]\nPlease face me when I speak\nPlease say to me somethin' before you leave\nYou've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you\nOh, the invisible truth stay sober\nI can't quite understand the games you play\nUnderstand, understand\nUnderstand I'm standin' under oath\nAnd I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore\nBut I'm cryin' at the bar\nI'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man\nI'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me\nAnd looked at me like you knew me\nBut I feel so alone\nLike I don't know anyone except the night sky above\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you're wonderin' where where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky (Father, Father, Father)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi (In the night sky)\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky (Father, Father, Father)\nAnd you're wonderin' where is God in your nightlife (In the night sky)",

Young and restless\nWhere restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace\nAnd next, these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus\nSomebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is\nI walk through the valley of the Chi where death is\nTop floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*\nTry to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard\nGetting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method\nThey be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us\nSayin' \"We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast\"\nHuh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?\nWe ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases\nA trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis\nMy mama used to say only Jesus can save us\nWell, mama, I know I act a fool\nBut I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope\n\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus, walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus, walk)\nAnd I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nI wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long\nSo long, so long\n(Jesus, walk with me)\n\n[Verse 2]\nTo the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers\n(Jesus walks with them)\nTo the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah\n(Jesus walks with them)\nNow, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly\nI know He hear me when my feet get weary\n'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct\nWe rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think\nI ain't here to argue about His facial features\nOr here to convert atheists into believers\nI'm just tryna say the way school need teachers\nThe way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus\nSo here go my single, dawg, radio needs this\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\nThat means guns, sex, lies, videotape\nBut if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?\nWell, if this take away from my spins\nWhich'll probably take away from my ends\nThen I hope it take away from my sins\nAnd bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout\nNext time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out\n\n[Chorus]\n(Jesus, walk)\nGod, show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down\n(Jesus, walk with me)\nThe only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n\n[Produced by Kanye West]",
