Why do stars fall down from the sky

And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town (Girls in town)
Follow you all around (Follow you all around)

Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played, I'd sing along

Those were such happy times
And not so long ago
How I wondered where they'd gone
But they're back again
Just like a long-lost friend
All the songs I loved so well

Every ""Sha-la-la-la""
Every ""Woah, woah-oh"" still shines
Every ""Shing-a-ling-a-ling""
That they're startin' to sing so fine
When they get to the part
Where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry
Just like before, it's yesterday once more

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad
So much has changed

It was songs of love
That I would sing to them
And I'd memorize each word
Those old melodies
Still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away

Every ""Sha-la-la-la""
Every ""Woah, woah-oh"" still shines

Everything I want the world to be

And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

I'm on the
top of the world, looking down on creation
And the only explanation I can find
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through, I hope that I will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All I need will be mine if you are here

Watching the signs along the way

Workin' together day to day, together

On the first night that we met
Together we've been happy
I have very few regrets
The ordinary problems
Have not been hard to face
But lately little changes
Have been slowly taking place

You're always finding something
Is wrong in what I do
But you can't rearrange my life
Because it pleases you

You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be
And if you're only using me
To feed your fantasy
You're really not in love
So let me go, I must be free

If what you want
Isn't natural for me
I won't pretend to keep you
What I am I have to be
The picture of perfection
Is only in your mind
For all your expectations
Love can never be designed

We either take each other
For everything we are
Or leave the life we've made behind
And make another start

You've got to love me for what I am
For simply being me (Simply being me)
Don't love me for what you intend
Or hope that I will be

I must face a world of strangers

It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But, I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be without
A friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But, I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near (When you're near, my love)

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest, I've found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give

Through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

I used to say, ""No promises, let's keep it simple""
But freedom only helps you say good-bye
It took a while for me to learn
That nothing comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of a quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at 4 a.m.
Without a friend in sight
Hanging on a hope, but I'm alright

Searching but not finding understanding anyway

Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappear each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way

Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waitin' was all my heart could do

Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filling the world surrounding me

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song, singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right

With ten thousand people watching

Though I've only known a few
For as rare as they are
Like a bright falling star
I found one in you

Sometimes
All the world can seem so friendless
And the road ahead so endless
And the dream so far away (Sometimes)
Sometimes when I'm almost to surrender
Then I stop and I remember
I have you to save my day

Often my imagination
Has me reaching out too far
When I fell you were there
With your hand in the air
You knew from the start

Sometimes
After all you've done to save me
Through the love you freely gave me
Every step along the way (Sometimes)
Sometimes
People ask what keeps me going
And in truth, it comes from knowing
I have you to save my day

Sometimes
Feeling helpless when I held you
Wishing words would come to tell you
I have you to save my day"

At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop

There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives

Go
I'm afraid my heart
Isn't very smart

Fly while you still have your wings
Knowing when to leave
Won't ever let you reach the point of no return
Fly
Foolish as it seems
I still have my dreams

So I keep hoping
Day after day as I wait for the man I need
Night after night as I wish for a love that can be
Though I'm sure that
No one can tell where their wishes and hopes will lead
Somehow I feel there is happiness waiting for me
When someone
Walks in your life you just better be sure he's right
'Cause if he's wrong
There are heartaches and tears you must pay
Keep both of your eyes on the door
Never let it get out of sight

Sail when the wind starts to blow
But like a fool I don't know
When to leave

In private 'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by

I just can't get over losing you
So if I should seem broken and blue
Walk on by

Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me have
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by

Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years

Every wish, one and all, waiting under the tree
Sleep well, little children, pleasant dreams through the night
Tomorrow is Christmas, all merry and bright
Soon you'll hear the bells ring, time for dreams to come true

As the world waits, you dream
Merry Christmas to you"
"41","Love Is Surrender","Carpenters","Close to You","","August 19, 1970","","142","24","","https://genius.com/Carpenters-love-is-surrender-lyrics","1096378","Talk about love
How it makes life complete
You can talk all you want
Make it sound good and sweet

But the words have an empty ring
And they don't really mean a thing
Without love, you are not to be found
You are not to be found

For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you care

Shout about love and the wars will all end
You can shout, ""We're all brothers""
And even pretend

But you can't cover up the past (Cover up the past)
Just pretending will never last
Without love you are nothing at all
You are nothing at all

For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you care
For love is surrender
You must surrender if you care
You must surrender if you care"

Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze
As seagulls fly, I knew that I was losing
Love was washed away with the drifting tide

Oh, it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you layin' up nights
Just waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart

Now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding (Ooh)
The future that lies before me, I cannot see
(Look at, look at the future I cannot see)
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising (Ooh)
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me

Oh, it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
It's got you layin' up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart

Ooh

Ooh

It's got you layin' up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame
When you've got to take the blame for a love song
(Gotta take the blame for a love song)
Because the best love songs
Are written with a broken heart
Oh, it's a dirty old shame
When all you get from love is a love song
(All you get from love is a love song)
It's got you layin' up nights
Waiting for the music to start
It's such a dirty old shame

Earth and sky appear to meet and end
But it's merely an illusion
Like your heart and mine, there is no sweet conclusion

I can see
No matter how near you'll be
You'll never belong to me
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I pretend
That I'm locked in the bend
Of your embrace?
For dreams are just like wine
And I am drunk with mine

I'm aware
My heart is a sad affair
There's much disillusion there
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I adore you
Although we are oceans apart?
I can't make you open your heart
But I can dream, can't I?

Can't I pretend
That I'm locked in the bend
Of your embrace?
For dreams are just like wine
And I am drunk with mine

I'm aware
My heart is a sad affair
There's much disillusion there
But I can dream, can't I?
Can't I adore you
Although we are oceans apart?
I can't make you open your heart
But I can dream, can't I?"

I like to be here alone
You just answer the door and feed the deer
And fight the telephone
Got to learn these words and I know you will
Or I'll send you right back to Guayaquil

Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home

Got to peel your eyes for the heat, my dear
You got to froth and foam
You got to send away the mad puppeteer
Who seems to think this is home
I want you to speak the English right
I want you to smile and be polite

Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home
Say b'wana she no home

I don't care if you drive my three-fifty, honey
Don't let 'em steal my chrome
I don't care if you spend all my money, honey
Long as you leave me alone
I just want you to try and remember one thing
If somebody knocks or the telephone rings

Say b'wana she no home (She no home)
Say b'wana she no home (B'wana)
Say b'wana she no home (B'wana)

And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told, and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that wishes would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Have you been sleeping, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Someday we'll find it
The Rainbow Connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
(Someday, someway, I know we'll find it)
The lovers, the dreamers and me"

To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate
The birds on the telephone line next time
Are crying out to me next time
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony
But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend
After all the tears we've spent how could we make amends?
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
I'll learn how to bend
It's gonna take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
And like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

All seem to say, ""Throw cares away""
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding, dong, ding, dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air
O, how they pound, raising the sound
Over hill and dale, telling their tale
Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
On, on they send, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home
Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells
