Now, here you go again
You say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should
Play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound
Of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat, (Heart) drives you mad (beat)
In the stillness (Still-) of remembering (-ness)
What you had (Lonely) and what you lost (Ooh, ooh)
And what you had (Ooh, ooh) and what you lost (Ooh)

Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'Players only love you when they're playing
Say, ""Women, they will come and they will go""
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

Now, here I go again
I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to
Wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat, (Heart) drives you mad (beat)
In the stillness (Still-) of remembering (-ness)
What you had (Lonely) and what you lost (Ooh, ooh)
And what you had (Ooh, ooh) Ooh, what you lost (Ah, ah)

Thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, ""Women, they will come and they will go""
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older

Back to the floor, that I love
To a room with some lace and paper flowers
Back to the gypsy that I was
To the gypsy that I was

And it all comes down to you
Well you know that it does
And lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
Oh, and it lights up the night
And you see your gypsy
You see your gypsy

To the gypsy that remains
Faces freedom with a little fear
I have no fear, I have only love
And if I was a child
And the child was enough
Enough for me to love
Enough to love

She is dancing away from me now
She was just a wish
She was just a wish
And a memory is all that is left for you now
You see your gypsy, oh
You see your gypsy

Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
And it all comes down to you
Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice
And it all comes down to you
I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes
And it all comes down to you"

See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey

Well, did she
make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale, up for sale

Well, did she
make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
Well, is it over now? Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?

Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years are the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you, I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win

Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly calm inside

So I try to say goodbye, my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue calm sea
I have always been a storm
Always been a storm
Ooh, always been a storm
I have always been a storm

Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
She called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love nor money
And I think she knew
Well the people, they love her
But still they're the most cruel
She asked me, be my sister
Sister, sister of the moon

Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooh, know her name?"

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
And wouldn't you love to love her?
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover?

All your life you've never seen a woman
Taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Will you ever win?

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
Rules her life like a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless
Once in a million years a lady like her rises
Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone
Your life knows no answer, yeah,  your life knows no answer

Would you even try?

Every one will suffer the fire we've made
They all explode just the same
And there's no going back on the plans we've made

Peacekeeper take your time
Wait for the dark of night
Soon all the suns will rise

Peacekeeper don't tell why
Don't be afraid to fight
Love is the sweet surprise
Ooh, ooh

Only creatures who are on their way
Ever poison their own well
But we still have time to hate
And there's still something we can sell

When the night is cold and still
When you thought you'd had your fill
Take all the time you will
This is not a test, it's not a drill
Take no prisoners, only kill
Ooh, ooh

You know all of our friends are gods
And they all tell us how to paint our face
But there's only one brush we need
It's the one that never leaves a trace (leaves a trace, leaves a trace)"

I turned off all the lights

You were by my side
Will you explain?

Real rhyme or reason for those future games

Now, you were there last night
And oh, were you afraid
Of things we'd come upon
While playin' future games
But baby, it's alright
And so have faith

Oh yeah
You invent the future that you want to face

How many people sit home at night
Wonderin' if they still will be here tonight?
Wonderin' if children they bring to the light
Inherit the world or inherit the night?
Wonderin' if neighbors are thinkin' the same
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame
Talking of journeys that happen in vain
Well, I know I'm not the only one
To ever spend my life sittin' playing future games

You better take your time
You know there's no escape
The future sends a sign
Of things we will create
Baby, it's alright

How many people sit home at night
Wonderin' if this day will be here tonight?
Wonderin' if children they bring to the light
