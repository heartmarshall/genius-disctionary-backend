Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another, a packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious
(So come on)

Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick a switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)

Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
(So come on)

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
And we will be victorious

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

You make me offers that I can't refuse

You make me offers that I can't refuse, yeah
You keep telling pretty lies
You play with the truth
Oh you're killing me with your

And don't fool yourself
This love's too good to last
And I'm too old to dream, yeah-yeah, ooh

Don't grow up too fast
And don't, mmm, embrace the past
This life's too good to last
And I'm too young to care, yeah-yeah, ooh

Don't kid yourself
And don't fool yourself
This life could be the last
And we're too young to see
Woah-woah-woah, mmm"

Won't let me sleep, your memories
And I know you're in this room, I'm sure I heard you sigh
Floating in between where our worlds collide

Scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, woah

And I know the moment's near
And there's nothing we can do
Look through a faithless eye
Are you afraid to die? Yeah

'Cause it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, woah

And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see

Come on and spread a sense of urgency
And pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end, the end
This is the end of the world

And it's time we saw a miracle
Come on, it's time for something biblical
To pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end
This is the end of the world

Proclaim eternal victory
Come on and change the course of history
And pull us through
And pull us through

And this is the end
This is the end of the world"
