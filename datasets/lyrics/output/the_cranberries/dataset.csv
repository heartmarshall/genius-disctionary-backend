Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we, mistaken?

But you see, it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head

It's tearing me apart, it's ruinin' everything
And I swore, I swore I would be true
And honey, so did you
So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand?
Were you lyin' all the time? Was it just a game to you?

But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused, and I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew I just wanna be with you

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?

Why should I blame her
That she filled my days
With misery or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways
Or hurled the little streets upon the great
Had they but courage equal to desire?

Sad that Maud Gonne couldn't stay
But she had MacBride anyway
And you sit here with me
On the isle Innisfree
And you are writing down everything
But I know by now
Why did you sit here

Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see? it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head they are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns

In your head
In your head
They are cryin'
In your head
In your head

Zombie, Zombie, Zombie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie Zombie Zombie

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is taking over
The violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916

In your head, In your head they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head, In your head
They are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, Zombie, Zombie
What's in your head, in your head

I'm still remembering the time
You said you'd be mine
Yesterday was cold and bare
Because you were not there
Yesterday was cold
My story has been told

I need your affection all the way
The world has changed or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way

I'm still remembering my life
Before I became your wife
I'm still remembering the pain
And the mind games
Reverse psychology, never tainted me
I didn't sell my soul, I didn't sell my soul

I need your affection all the way
The world has changd or I've changed in a way
I try to remain
I'm trying not to go insane
I need your affection all the way

They say the cream will always
Rise to the top
They say that good people
Are always first to drop
What of Kurt Cobain
Will his presence still remain
Remember J.F.K
Ever saintly in a way

Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
I say, where are you now

With a Smith and Wesson .38
John Lennon's life was no longer a debate
He should have stayed at home
He should have never cared
And the man who took his life declared, he said:

""I Just Shot John Lennon!""
He said: ""I Just Shot John Lennon!""
What a sad and sorry and sickening sight
It was a sad and sorry and sickening night

Oh a sad and sorry and sickening sight
