Tell me\nI would rather feel everything than nothing every time\nOoh, fear me, stranger, a little bit of sugar, danger\nI'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view\nI do, I do, I do, I do\n\nI don't remember too much of the last year\nBut I knew who I was when I got here\n'Cause I'm still the same but only entirely different\nAnd my lover’s just some lines in some songs, mm\n\nYou think you’ve read the book I'm still writing\nI can’t imagine wanting so badly to be right\nGuess I'm forever on your mind\nI wonder why\n\nWhat's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me (Tell me)\nI would rather feel everything than nothing every time (Every, every time)\nOoh, fear me, stranger (Stranger), a little bit of sugar (Sugar), danger (Danger)\nI'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view\n\nRather be swimming with you than drowning in a crowded room\nI do, I do, I do, I do"
