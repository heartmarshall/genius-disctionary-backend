One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazin'
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me

Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight

Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you

Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time

Threw away my reputation, but saved us more heartache
Yes, I know it seems fucked up and you're right
But quite frankly, you’re still wrong about everything
So far off, your seat's nowhere near the table
But I find something sweet in your peculiar behavior
'Cause I think to be so dumb must be nice
I do, I do, I do, I do

What makes you think you’re even invited?
The doors are closed with lights off inside and all the while
Therе's no one home, you're still outsidе
I wonder why

What's wrong with a little bit of poison? Tell me
I would rather feel everything than nothing every time
Ooh, fear me, stranger, a little bit of sugar, danger
I'd rather be seen and alive than dying by your point of view
I do, I do, I do, I do

I don't remember too much of the last year
But I knew who I was when I got here
'Cause I'm still the same but only entirely different
And my lover’s just some lines in some songs, mm

You think you’ve read the book I'm still writing
I can’t imagine wanting so badly to be right
Guess I'm forever on your mind

Be my fire in the cold

'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
Baby, I be fallin'
You're my moonlight, moonlight

He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he's holding me tight
And he calls me ""Moonlight"" too"
