Better learn something, son\nYou be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?\nLook, ooh, you see me, Ma, they wish they could be me, Ma\nAs I got better, her body was eaten by leukaemia\nSeventh grade, it was cursed and sad\nBut the gift within it was when I first met Chad\nBut even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed\n'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12-19\nI can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under\n'Cause fifteen years later, the other died that summer\nBummer\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nMy best friend told me (What?)\nYou be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)\nBut the weight of the world can really crush one's mind\nSo let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nLet it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nSee, you won't even know you hurt sometimes\nUntil you in conversations, it comes out in a line\nSo let it out, P (What?) Let it out, P (What?)\nLet it out, P (What?) My nigga, let it out\n\n[Verse 2: Pharrell]\nAyo, 1021 Atlantis Drive, nigga was action packed\nThat's Atlantis Apartments, we live in half the back\nThat's where the 12-year-olds there, they be flashing crack\nAnd when they shoot you, nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back\nAyo, Didi, Fleet and Marvian, can you imagine that?\nThe place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat\nBut I escaped 'cause I chased what made me passionate\nNow I got my skate team and spit these acid raps\nSo many niggas will rise, so many them niggas try\nSo many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied\nSo many them same niggas, man, they moms' eyes cry\nSo, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride\nWell, let me tell you niggas something, I'm so glad you alive\nLong as you got a breath, a pulse, nigga strive\nDivine intervention this is, I heard a voice, nigga, listen to this\n\n[Chorus: Pharrell]\nMy best friend told me (What?)\nYou be actin' tough, that's fine (Uh-huh)\nBut the weight of the world can really crush one's mind\nSo let it out, P (What?)

Haha, yessir\n\n[Verse 2]\nNigga, you don't know me\nI'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy\nFirst trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie\nKeep one on my staff with a new pro chromey\nIt bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten\nBut affords me to chuckle at what critics have written\nHe dresses insane, but his music admire\nAsk Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire\nAnd Vanity Fair; you like Kennedy here\nBut you should guess who's in the insanity chair\nNow it ain't about what I want\nStill thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn\nIt's one thing to say that you did it\nIt's one thing to lie about your digits\nIt's one thing to say that you live it\nIt's another for you fuckers to admit it\nBut I admit I got all this paper\nPlus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature\nI drive a case'per, 'scuse me, Casper\nWanna meet 'em in my house, I got space like NASA\nBut it don't make me happier by itself, it's sadder\nOr like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa\nOr Ben dad gettin' a stroke, and nothin' to trap her\nJohn could do, it's ironic but true\nA man dies, baby born, it's fair as Peru\nIt's a simple clue between us and imposters\nWe hop in the air and don't care what it cost us\nNow I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers\nI guess you could say that we fly like saucers\nZappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor\nThe cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher Mag gripper\nGo 'head and say it, \"You a rappin' ass nigga\"\nYessir\n\n[Chorus]\nMy nigga, close your eyes\nJust picture yourself just holdin' pies\nImplement a plan and you surely rise\nThis promised by the man that controlled the skies\nDon't you see? I know that shit so ill\nBetter yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel\nHaha, how you feel, dawg?\nWe just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'\nBleedin', readin', all in the late night\nShakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'\nShapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right\nAs I serve it, you just burn it\nBreathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight\nNigga, how does it feel?
