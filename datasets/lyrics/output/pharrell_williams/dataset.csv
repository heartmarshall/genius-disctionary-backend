Girl, girl, girl, girl

Pretend, make believe or hide, uh

But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl

Yeah
Ever been in love before?
I wanna holla at you, maYou know it's hard for a player to admit that sometimesBut I'ma spit that sometimes, y'know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, P, give it to me one time nephew

There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
She from around the way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
It wouldn't stay, wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself that it isn't
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

Yes sir, that's her
But it wasn't like that back when I met her
The lavish life from all the dough spun
Before the double R had to hitchhike thumb
Her friends didn't like niggas like us
But I arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed
Spider web sex must have got caught up
But there's more to it I remember once
Sayin' ""Let's shit on the peons
Let's go to Vegas and watch Celine Dion""
Make 'em say ""What we on?""
You say no like you was doin' it for eons
Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons
When it rains it pours, I laugh to myself when I change the score
You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more
And somethin' 'bout how your ex was a toy, I guess he played games
It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify
But when you shut your eye you can touch the sky
You in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed
But if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

What you say, say, say?
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away (Run away, run away), simply run away, oh
Check it out, check it out
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself that it isn't
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

See I'm a crip in dark blue Chucks
And I does what I does yeah I might say ""cuz""
It's really weird cause a nigga got love
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood
She told me that her baby daddy was a thug
Now it is what it is and it was not was
I'm hollerin' at lil mama like what
Monday morn stack tryna get my cheese back
All these memories breed seed to the rhythm rhyme pleaser
Lay back while we sippin' on a breezer
Fresh four pack sittin' in the freezer
Ain't that Kadija I heard she was a skeezer
She used to hit them licks wit' the visas
When I seen her wit the homies I was like ""Jesus""
It's been a little minute since I seen her
Hope her man don't run up cause I'll have to pull the nina

There's something 'bout this girl man, from around my way
Ever try to hold back your feelings, but it just wouldn't stay
But when I finally found the words to say
I wanted to run away, simply run away, oh
You can try to run and hide, it won't make a difference
You can lie to yourself that it isn't
Sure it hurts when it comes to your attention
That you're in love with the girl

There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man
There's somethin' 'bout this girl man

I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

Bad day at work, crazy boss, crazy hours
Finger pointin', but they, they depend on you
Inhale, exhale, in and out like a sail
No, no, aw, yes, smile, honey, no stress

When your environment seems to get brighter
You know it's good
And the situation doesn't seem that bad
You know it's good
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?
You know it's good
Perception that you never had
You know it's good

You know who you are and I know what you're feelin'
You know who you are and I know what you're feelin'

(I want every woman to make a pledge with me)
Say your name, I pledge to live life on the edge
Want you to know, I see the power is in me
No more acquiesce, standin' up with no stress
I will do what I need 'til every woman on the Earth is free

I don't mind
I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin'

You know who you are and I know what you're feelin'

And girl, don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time
We just shake our heads and dance, the moment so surreal
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels

I know who you are and I know what you're feelin'
I know who you are and I know what you're feelin'

Let me tell you one more time
I don't mind
I know what you're feelin', feelin', feelin'

Take two of these and call me in the morning
You should see the way the chain harness the charm and
Fly, I'm like a bird like Nelly Furtado
Shit, pop your bottles, toast and scream, ""Cheers!""
Get your two-step 'cause this the record of the year
Nigga that brought you Ice Creams, two for a pair
Officially announcing, ""This is warfare,"" 'cause
Back in the day, my clouds was grey
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away
But then I sold my first verse and copped that NSX
But I was still ridin' in them thin-ass jets, but now
Man, my vision so clear out the window of the Lear
And I'm talkin' on my celly all the shit that you should hear
Listen clearly now

From Louis deals to Jimmy Choos, he's real
She know the time, she sees the Richard Mille
Plat-double skeletal, Tourbillion
It's just like her body, move, it turns her on
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers
And all our car doors go up like Transformers
See, I can do it this-a-way, I can do it that-a-way
From the crib in Virginia to that new Miami getaway
So cool it like New Edition 'less you hot as you say
I get it, okay, let it boil away
But please run along, 'cause ladies is feelin' wrong
And I got something right for them right after this song
My name is Skateboard P

On and on and the temperature is warm and
I spit heat flashes, niggas get nauseous
Bright as a bitch, so analyze with caution
When the light hit the ice, bet a hundred that you vomit
Should I mention the fact the Transition is the track?
No incision to the vision just to get me where I’m at, huh
Little Skateboard, he too grown (Come on)
Ridin' up and down Collins in that new Two-Tone
It's so cold, you don't wanna feel the chill of it (Uh)
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it (Uh)
I don't smoke but I bet the sense a mil' of it
Totally intensifies the vivid-ass appeal of it
You can be jealous and grit your teeth (Uh huh)
But all these lil' niggas got somethin' in reach
So, you want heat? These niggas can front heat
While I'm on my boat party, tryin' to Sunseek
My name is Skateboard P

Can I have it like that? (You got it like that)

But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody else's carelessness?
Pop, there goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine ten years old, full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceit
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, ""You about what you weep""
She used to help me with my homework, addition, subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted
Wanna skip your mind from crying? Better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums?
Look, ooh, you see me, Ma, they wish they could be me, Ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by leukaemia
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'Cause Grandma Loucelle died on 12-19
I can't help but wonder what kind of black cloud I was under
'Cause fifteen years later, the other died that summer

Look at the reflection of my foreign car, the R&R
I stick my feet out, you know the Bapes that's made of eel
You know the new shits with Nigo face right on the heel

Bought that white 5-50, so white that the coke heads just might try sniff
Or ordered the Phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack rock beige

I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch, but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass – trust me, I'ma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream while I'm gettin' my cream
I'm
Coming To America
, call me Prince Akeem, yessir
It's kinda weird, 'cause this our dream
Kinda prophetic, you get it – 'cause this, I've seen
These type of visions, since I was teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed Visine
Laughed with the class, but with the slightest clue
You'd be buying my shit, and I be rappin' to you
But you can do it, too

You can do it, too, young love
You can do it, too, young love
Just watch what you do, young love
And watch whose in your crew, young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it, too, young love
I did, you can do it, too

I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell, he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems that he has accused
He's really frustrated and all that he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next thing – bang, comes out the barrell
And my man they accused sittin' tight up in jail
Ironically close, my man Lou can hear him yell
""I ain't do it,"" but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia, Grandma went back
The line was fluctuated, but it just now went flat
See, her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me, so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm horny when I fuck
Wealthy niggas with a conscience, yeah, you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read 'til the day
But still ya high sadity 'cause you got a lil' paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me, it's the nature
Never underestimate the things you do
Read Job verse 2, inhale the ""ooh"", and go

You can do it, too, young love
You can do it, too, young love
Just watch what you do, young love
And watch whose in your crew, young love
It don't matter if you do drugs
And even if you threw slugs
You can do it, too, young love
I did, you can do it, too

Don't be afraid to look up in the sky
Don't be afraid to look up in the sky
Don't be afraid to look up in the sky
Don't be afraid to look up in the sky

Yessir, haha, lil' Skateboard P
(Woo, woo)
Hey, Mr. Vener
(Woo, woo)
Uh-huh, yo, hola
(Woo)

Billionaire Club, muchacho
Assorted flavors in these helados
Inspire young minds, and stack my nachos
With the raw determination of a vato
Run across the border with bricks in his poncho
Face like a shot when it's bussin' my glocko
Planning these things 'til I die
When the Holy Father hand me my wings
When I was young, yo, the teacher couldn't stand when we dreamed
Giving me music like drugs in the hand of a fiend, they shoot it up
See me on the TV, the cuties, they wanna fuck
Both residential, that's plush, they couped it up
Got more hits than a zip, who want a nug'?
I can go back in time, you be Judge Ito
With my minute repeater, I know you're thinking, ""Neato""
It repeats the minutes, something like your TiVo
But it's three-hundred thousand more with no remote
Jacob and Lorraine, I used to deal with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's Fritos
Now the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo
Ree-on, same song sung by my man Nigo
SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar
Nigga, we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost
(Uh) Yessir

My nigga, close your eyes
Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise
This promised by the man that controlled the skies
Don't you see? I know that shit so ill
Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Haha, how you feel, dawg?
We just picture thinkin', dreamin', schemin'
Bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shakin', boilin', lacin', bakin'
Shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it
Breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight
Nigga, how does it feel? Haha, yessir

Nigga, you don't know me
I'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy
First trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie
Keep one on my staff with a new pro chromey
It bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten
But affords me to chuckle at what critics have written
He dresses insane, but his music admire
Ask Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire
And Vanity Fair; you like Kennedy here
But you should guess who's in the insanity chair
Now it ain't about what I want
Still thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn
It's one thing to say that you did it
It's one thing to lie about your digits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper
Plus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature
I drive a case'per, 'scuse me, Casper
Wanna meet 'em in my house, I got space like NASA
But it don't make me happier by itself, it's sadder
Or like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa
Or Ben dad gettin' a stroke, and nothin' to trap her
John could do, it's ironic but true
A man dies, baby born, it's fair as Peru
It's a simple clue between us and imposters
We hop in the air and don't care what it cost us
Now I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor
The cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher Mag gripper
Go 'head and say it, ""You a rappin' ass nigga""
Yessir

My nigga, close your eyes
Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise
This promised by the man that controlled the skies
Don't you see? I know that shit so ill

In the heart of a re-up, it's somethin' like a g-up
M-C-A fingering that b-up or that c-up
Fiends creep up with their flesh lookin beat up
And my tennis ball is stuffed with enough work to fill a tea cup
He opened up his jacket, I opened up my packet
He pulled out his money, I'm pullin' out that honey
He stuff it in his stem soon as he took it from me
Yellow teeth chapped lips and his nose is runny
He lit that shit, he hit that quick
As if I was high I asked him where them bricks at, shit
He smiled as if he was payin' homage
He said in the back of the apartment
Where they be selling ganja
But beware of the AK held by Haitian Thomas
Son gotta keep him high in them bottoms or some old pajamas
I said shit my nigga take another hit
We ran up in that crib with them Uzis and them Sigs
Give up the work or we tyin' up the kids
Did I get that work? what you think, yes I did
I didn't, actually that wasn't true
But if you aspire to hustle that's a
How-to to you

This that shit make you wanna hustle

So you can style on these niggas (Holla back)
So you can style on these niggas (Ya, follow that)

Its incredible how I etch my plans out
To be physically subtle and financially stand out
You should see me stick the baguettes on my hands out
And literally carve a structure so no one can touch ya
Teenage girls'll love ya and models wanna fuck ya
Ice cream ya way on to somebody's magazine cover
So much money that the lid threatens eruption
And the bank says you don't
Have to call like you're Usher
And I ain't kill or sell drugs to nobody
But I know niggas that kill and stretch work like pilates
Nigga the crack house was literally right beside me
When them fiends hit that shit they kick just like karate
We named one Bruce lie, one slim Kelly
Who issued too much quicker than luis rank and m belly
Yeah, I escaped but there's nothing you can tell me
'Cause though I paperchase my memories won't fail me

In the hood wake up to the hammer noise
Sound like the work of my jerks the swagger boys
Pull up in them eyes wide open
Stack of toys
If your girl want to leave with us that's her choice
The feelin throbbin' I got it and poppin' phenomenon
Nigga signed a million dollar check wit his pajamas on
Film it like a porno no need to re-word it
Nigga the Enzo just came and I ain't have to jerk it
Yeah niggas you heard it the perversion of stars
I guess if I go in my garage it'd be a ménage
Niggas can't hate on this like summer in '84
Knee highs and potato chips
New cript and Florida were the soul core corridors
Yes them babies mine, fuck I need to go on Maury for
Rewire my brain, aspire to attain
Tell Jacoblight on the platinum keep the fire in the chain
Yikes I mean ice on the motherfucker gleam
I guess if my ice is fire it leave you niggas stinged
See there's you, there's me, and there's between
If you remove the between you see I achievin' you dreams

Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit

Ayo, I walk in brashest, certainly the crassest
The restaurant's classes, the owner is asses
Shit, my money green like the helmet of a fascist
So what you want – Patron or Petrucia glasses?
Ain't no mystery, his daughter know the history
And every night we toast like it's victory, get with me
And I ain't changed since my early mental
I been snackin' on shrimp and sippin' on Shirley Temples
No drug to drinkin' – what you want?
No, seriously, what you thinkin'? Since the Yukon
Never puffed a J, you can ask Loushawn
Back when he pushed beige like it was coupons
With a house full of dames like it was Moulin
I would ask they names, but they would only do Sean
And I ain't sayin' they regret it, but fuck it, they do
'Cause if they could reverse time, nigga
What would they do, huh?

Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit

Honeys Panamanian, eyes like Iranian
Lighter than the blue of the sky of the day we in
Ass like a volleyball, the kind that make your dick hard
Head to the hustlers, so sweet she could get cars
Now she here with me, lil' Skateboard P
Cheaper than the sound of a bird that chirps
I spit, then I hit, then I murk, yessir
A flick chico stick and a Twix, that's her
She admire how the champion live
How I signed Slim Thug with a ramp in my crib
I'm a champion, I do as the champions did
Except I improve with the new and the rest get rid
But some of y'all don't like that, it's easy tryna bite back
Instead of sayin' hi, gettin' fly, but I'll be right back
My dude got the steel if you think you fly
Shoot the wings off your ego and watch you skydive, yessir

Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit
Don't try to come up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, raspy shit

I took it on the chin when I heard about the lame
And no, I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Nah)
That don't measure up to all the nights that we laughed
When considering love, you take the good with the bad
I've been disappointed by every bitch I ever had
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags
Reverse it, I want perfect
That was half the reason I bought half them purses
That chapter is over, it was worth it
My new angel surfaced
She ain't have to rehearse it

Come on, hah
Move like that
Look at here, can you move like that?
Huh, move like that
Look at here, can you move like that?

It keeps me up (crave)
Anxiety (crave)
Even when I'm yawnin'
With your machine gun, brrrrmp-a-ding-ding
I keep rollin' over (crave)
I can't get no sleep (crave)
My love is pourin', yeah from ya
Machine gun, brrrrmp-a-ding-ding

Bang bang, feel the pain
Everybody, feel the pain
Bang bang, feel the pain
Everybody, feel the pain

So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (you got me holdin' my hand)
So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (so I'm here waitin')
For you, girl
(Let's party!)

Take what you want (crave)
Take what you need (crave)
Move me around, baby
With your machine gun, brrrrmp-a-ding-ding
And I'm so gone (crave)
Girl now you're free (crave)
You shoot me down baby, from your...
Machine gun, brrrrmp-a-ding-ding

Bang bang, feel the pain
(Oh you got me)
Everybody, feel the pain
(In a heartbeat)
Bang bang, feel the pain
(I give up)
Everybody, feel the pain

So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (you got me holdin' my hand)
So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (so I'm here waitin')
For you, girl

Help me, ah
Help me, ah
Help me, ah
Help me, ah
You know, uh...
Feels good right? (Here we go!)
Girls in the front, ah, can you feel the crave?
Oh, can you feel that crave?
Girls in the back, ah, can you feel the crave?
Oh, can you feel that crave?
Girls on the left, ah, can you feel the crave?
Oh, can you feel that crave?
Girls on the right, ah, can you feel the crave?
Can somebody help me?

So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (you got me holdin' my hand)
So help me (cravin')
I'm on the sidewalk (you got me cravin')
I'm fallin' over (you got me cravin')
Rockin' back and forth (so I'm here waitin')
For you, girl

Help me, ah
Help me, ah

Oh, no, here comes a pretty girl, pretty girl
Uh-oh, here comes a pretty girl
Hey

I know what you are thinkin'
I know what you will say
You made up this whole far-fetched thing about the reasons that I have changed
Well, I'm still the tiger
And the jungle's still my home
But she blew out my fire
And now, my killer instincts are gone
What did you do?

Everything's lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Ever since it occurred to me
That you are the prettiest girls

My life is so amazing
Let me explain how it got that way
Well, if happiness was standing at your door
I mean, tell me what would you say?
But I'm no liar, and you rearranged my home
And I wonder how I don't get tired
Of loving the three of you instead of what I own
All that is gone

Everything's lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Ever since it occurred to me
That you are the prettiest girls

What are you doing to me?
What's so drastic all my friends see?
You say nothing, nothing, nothing
But it's really something, something, something, oh
You won't answer me, and all the while
My heart just melts from your innocent smile
It's strange
Oh, God, I think I've changed, ha-ha
There's one thing that's sure
Is everyday I love you some more
My hand's been handcuffed and loved by you
So is there really anything I could do?
When...

Everything's lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Ever since it occurred to me
That you are the prettiest girls"

(Look what you've done to me, done to me)
Make me behave like I wouldn't ever (ever)
I know you're the one for me
(I know you're the one for me, one for me)
Your essence is the ink in the word forever (ever)

Oh, your significance, every cloud knows
Ask the flowers, ask the snow
It is even deeper than the ocean can go
Can you image

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live on you alone for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)

Look what you've done to me
(Look what you've done to me, done to me)
Make me behave like I wouldn't ever (ever)
I know you're the one for me
(I know you're the one for me, one for me)
Your essence is the ink in the word forever (ever)

Oh, how could I forget to mention
You're the only melody that gets my attention
I already believe, don't need no convincing
Excuse me, and I'm not asking

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live alone on your love for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)

Your rainbow (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water)
Is all of me (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water)
From every moment's pixelation (the water, the water, the water)
(Water, water) To Orion's constellation
(The water, water) Beyond what we can see
(Water)

I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
I'm crystal clear (like the water, water, water)
Live alone on your love for years
And no, that isn't fasting, no, no
(like the water, water, water)

Yeah
