You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry (No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes), no

No, no, no, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No, no, no, no
No, no, no (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
(No way that you'll see me cry)
Ah-ah, ah-ah (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

That makes me wanna stay

I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is comin'
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is somethin' I gotta face

If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
For you, I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

Could you break my fall?

There you go, saving me from out of the cold

But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me

But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses

How can I make you understand?

Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Cipriani's
Like Beyoncé, they're gettin' by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce (Oh-oh), a whole lot of tears (Oh-oh)
Rollin' down her cheeks, crying 'til she's sound asleep

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denyin' every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

We all guilty of the same crime

But she handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
'Til I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the Fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free

Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know

Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

Even though I know that you don't live there now
Lately you're the only thing on my mind
And I can't stop myself from drivin' by your house

Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somеbody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll nеver be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

Livin' out of suitcases in hotels
Drinking way too much and talking through the night
Really wish I didn't know you so well
Wouldn't be so hard to leave the past behind

Ooh, every time I hear our song it kind of hurts me still
And, ooh, even after all this time, I kinda miss you still
I'm wondering

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back?
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever

Mmm, mmm
No, I, I, I, I
I'm, I'm
Mmm, mmm

Do you even think about it?
The way that we changed the world
And don't it make you sad
That we'll never be kids again?
No, we'll never be kids again
Tell me how you live without it
Did somebody change your world
And now you don't look back
'Cause we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never be kids again
No, we'll never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever"

Look into my eyes, take me to the clouds above
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
Wish I had you near me now
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?

How will I know if you really love me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if you're thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy, can't speak
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
This love is strong why do I feel weak

If you love me
If you love me, no
If you love me
If you love me, no"
