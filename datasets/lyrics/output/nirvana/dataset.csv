One at Salem's lot

As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead, I had a dad
I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before

Was when I learned to cry on command

It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you

One more special message to go
And then I'm done, and I can go home

Bitten by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
Flew away howling on the yellow moon

They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
Go to a lake of fire and fry

Look for a dry place to call their home
Try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make 'em their own

She'd push food through the door
I crawl towards the cracks of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down

The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twitch and masturbate

Why?
I said so
I said so
I said so

Black windows of paint
I scratch with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point at my way
They come with their flashing lights
And take my family away

And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you

To take
Me with
Your life

Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away, pain
Hand out lobotomies
To save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland, boring, plain!

Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough of the words
You go along and I sing your song

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!

Holy now is restitution
Living out your date of fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty, master writing

If I had to touch feeling
I would lose my soul
The way I do
I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
But that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice sprinkled with emotion?
Invented at your birth

I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse, I cannot see
Formulate infinity
Store it deep inside me

Are we or not?

One more day to complete my service
One more high to decay my nervous
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more debt to complete my service
One more time here to fade my servant
One more day if I find a way; over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

Old age
Old age
Old age
Old age

One more day to complain my servant
One more doubt here to find a servant
One more time here if I find a way; it's over
Wondering how I'll maintain my cover
One more day here to save my lover
Wondering how I'm gonna find a way; it's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know a later time
We could lay here with you
Leave the soul

Just you need, you read, you're a freak
Hmmm
And knew, you read, you flew
Ooo
Hmmm

One more day to complete my circuit
One more high here to find my nervous
Someday I'm gonna find a way; it's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper
I can have anything you want to
One more day if I find a way; it's over

She seemed to read minds
And I know we run out of time
Breathe the way here with you
Dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her
Take a moan on a man
Breathe the shame onto you
Breathe the lie

Help me trust your mighty wisdom

Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box

He loves her more than he will ever show

Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart
