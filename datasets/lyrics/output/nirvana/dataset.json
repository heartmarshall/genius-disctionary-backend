    "lyrics": "Fuck you all, this is the last song of the evening\nWhat is it?\nThis was written by (Uh, what?) my favorite performer. Our favorite performer, isn't it? All of ours? You like him the best?\nOh! And there's a donation basket. Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar\nOh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars\nWe're passing a basket if anyone-\nYeah, I even asked David Ges— Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay\n\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\nHer husband was a hard working man\nJust about a mile from here\nHis head was found in a driving wheel\nBut his body never was found\n\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\nShiver for me\n\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, the pines the sun don't shine\nI'd shiver… the whole night through\n\nThank you"
