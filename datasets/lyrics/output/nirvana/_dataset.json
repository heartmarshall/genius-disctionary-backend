Kurt wants to buy Lead Belly's guitar\nOh yeah, this guy representing the Lead Belly estate wants to sell me Lead Belly's guitar for five hundred thousand dollars\nWe're passing a basket if anyone-\nYeah, I even asked David Ges— Geffen personally if he'd buy it for me and he wouldn't do it. Okay\n\n[Verse 1: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\n[Verse 2: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\n[Verse 3: Kurt Cobain]\nHer husband was a hard working man\nJust about a mile from here\nHis head was found in a driving wheel\nBut his body never was found\n\n[Verse 1: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\nShiver for me\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Verse 2: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\n[Verse 1: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, don't lie to me\nTell me where did you sleep last night?\nIn the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine\nI would shiver the whole night through\n\n[Verse 2: Kurt Cobain]\nMy girl, my girl, where will you go?\nI'm going where the cold wind blows\nIn the pines, the pines the sun don't shine\nI'd shiver… the whole night through\n\n[Instrumental Outro]\n\n[Spoken: Kurt Cobain]\nThank you",
