Was I right?\nOh, love, I don't know\nI wasn't perfect for sure\nBut now I feel like a new born baby\nLying in the dew of the morning\nLaughing at the sky\nLike a brave new Apollo\n\nAnd I shall rise from the ashes\nGrow like a rose from the ruins\nThere must be light in the darkness\nHope at the end of the night\nYes, I've been tryin' all my life\nTo get to heaven\nBut awoke in the eye of the storm\nBut I shall rise from the ashes\nGrow from the ruins\nAnd return back home\nBack home\n\n[Outro]",
