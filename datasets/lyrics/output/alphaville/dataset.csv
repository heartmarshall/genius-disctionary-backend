Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad man

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, and ever

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? (Forever)"

All around my head and in the wind
I had no illusions that I'd ever find
A glimpse of summer's heatwaves in your eyes

You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan, alright
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes of strange illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo?
Or should I go and change my point of view for other ugly scenes?

You did what you did to me
Now it's history, oh, you see
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight

I tune it into the scene, my hands are resting on her shoulders
When we're dancing away for a while

Oh, we're moving, we're falling, we step into the fire
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream
There's no reason to hurry, just start that brand new story
Set it alight, we're head over heels in love, head over heels

The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while
The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while

It's the definite show, our shadows resting in the moonlight
It's so clear and bright in your eyes
It's the touch of your sighs, my lips are resting on your shoulder
When we're moving so soft and slow

We need the ecstasy, the jealousy, the comedy of love
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before
Give me more tragedy, more harmony, and fantasy, my dear
And set it alight, just staring at the satellite, set it alight

The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while
The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a, go for a while"

Open your eyes
And let the Sun break in for a while
There may be something
That you've never seen inside

Feel how your heart beats like a
Heavy machine
The sound of the traffic is like a
Silent dream

The dust in the park
The exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon
You touch a sweaty body

Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
The days feel so tired
From the lead in the air
And the fire in the skies
Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay
It gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads

Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
The heat of the sun
Which is stored in the pavement
Feels so fine
Here stands the innocent
And there it comes oh so wild
That's when you're longing
For a summer by the wall

To the future turned we stand

Nobody told me we'd be all alone

Somewhere my friend he'd left me
In that red light zone
You know
She said: I've seen your deepest secrets, son
They're just as lightning
In the look of your eyes

I said: I want you, baby
I said: I want some more
I said: I never ever felt it like that moment before
She's an assassin
She's melting steel in my heart
But I long for more
She said: I want your body
She said: I want your soul

She's an invader
She's from another world
But I beg for more and more

She's pouring fire into my liquid life
There's no escaping from her mysteries
She gives my kisses of the strangest kind

She says: I know you'll like it
So come over here

Through your body, dear

She always did it and she always will
She'll stay that hunter

You might be the one I'm waiting for

Chasing shadows leaves you feeling blue
This situation needs a cure
New assassins, new messiahs
Keepers of the balanced law
Strangest lovers of the fire

Strange is the night

Catch the next train from self pity
It takes you straight to Heartbreak City
Don’t have to ask for a first class ticket
Because it’s free for those who deserve the visit

Take a walk on lonely street now
Don’t you stop, don’t you shuffle your feet now
Never look back to where you came from
Nothing there but a goblin maelstrom
You’re goin’ to…

Heartbreak City, you can’t let go
The fools in love, the too much and the not enough
Heartbreak City, strange is the night
Where black stars rise with strange moons in the skies

Days obscured by silent sorrow
I hope to hell it’s better tomorrow
Fools are nailed at the glowing skyline
Burning angels make, ooh, the night shine

One last chance now and you’ve had many
Oh, they all, they just passed you by
Hold on tight now, the train is moving
Another day, another goodbye
Say hello to…

Heartbreak City, you can’t let go
The fools in love, the too much and the not enough
Heartbreak City, a creeping sorrow
A pallid dolly, ten courts to hell and a dead man’s folly

The fools in love
Heartbreak, strange is the night
Where black stars rise
Heartbreak, a pallid dolly
A dead man's folly
Heartbreak, it don’t heal clean
The fools in love (the too much and the not enough)

Heartbreak City, it don’t heal clean
The fools in love, the too much and the not enough
Heartbreak City, strange is the night
Where black stars rise with strange moons in the skies

Heartbreak City, the king in yellow
The falling rain, they won’t help to ease your pain

Catch the next train from self pity
It takes you straight to Heartbreak City
Catch the next train from self pity
It takes you straight to Heartbreak City"

So I've been told

In the park, she's giving out some photographs
On which she's giving out some photos of what she hands around
""They videoed a ghost tonight,"" she said before I turned it out
""It rode an orange paper bike, and left without a sound. ""
Keep on riding, Sir
Open up the door and shout it out:

Lonely Girl dancing in the music hall
Lightning struck her silver starship and turned it into stone
And now it's falling all the time into that void beyond her gray eyes
Somewhere a telephone is ringing, but nobody's at home
""Hello Junkie Sweetheart, listen now
This is your Captain calling:
Your Captain is dead.""
Keep on riding, Sir. Open up the door
And shout it out, shout it out
Shout it out, shout it out

Telling the truth by making a big lie

And everybody's looking for clues
And you know what to do with a clue

Dig that deal and be a millionaire
Drinking cocktails in the stratosphere
Getting jet lagged with my business friends
In these supersonic wonderlands

Drifting slowly to the point of no return
Self control and grace is something I should learn

Leave behind what’s on my mind

And that today it is black
And that tomorrow it is red
And we know that when we go to the sun

Just waiting for a foreign sound from the outside
Far beyond the atmospheres, she is listening for a call
To take her homewards to herself
Oh, I love you so
He who's master of the icy shots won't harm you in the morning
She knows that the pavement's hard
There between the stars
To travel on to Martian-Homesick-City

She is weeping silently, but there‚s not a tear
Just raindrops falling from the painted ceiling
The dance of the foraging bee will number all the things
She has been longing for since she was young
""I will not pass this night in vain"", she says
""I'll stand this kind of rain
I'll break the glass, I'll find the path""
Yes, Carol wants to go to Mars
Back where the red, cold sun
Is sinking to the Channels of A'DAAR

Day breaks through the grating
Someone moves a chair
And sunlight blisters dazzling on a glass
Take a pill and greet the day
For sedative holidays
Why aren't you sleeping at night?
Oh, I love you so
He who's master of the icy shots won't harm you 'til the evening
We shall meet tomorrow night
And I'll kiss you just as tenderly
As CYGNUS kissed the deserts

Intentions you can't hide
With tightened lips
You're sinking ships
In the shadows of the night
You presidents of genocide
You ministers of crime
You're laughing at your firemen
From miles behind
From miles behind the lines..!

To cut a long story short

To meet the guardians of the Isles
The valient captains will rule the seas

Release that dream into the world
Join in the air race, leaving tonight

You hear my laughs just before you close your eyes
It's me

Some call it karma, some call it destiny
Your doors are safely locked but I hold the keys
My friends inside are legion waiting for their release

And I felt kind of homesick
Although you were with me

Save a prayer, a prayer for me
When will I ever come back again?
Save a prayer, a prayer for me
When will I ever come back, come back again?

When the circle is fulfilled
When the planes are coming back
And I'll be there to welcome you home
And it will be my turn
And nothing shall be left
But memories and faded photographs
You see, I'm on my way
Some have to go, some have to stay

Save a prayer, a prayer for me
When will I ever come back again?
Save a prayer, a prayer for me
When will I ever come back, come back again?

Modesty is fine but it doesn't get you very far
When you make your decision
Don't be afraid of the dark

Longing for the golden ball
That it will be yours for keeps
Be sure about it as you saw
So shall you reap

He has more gold than anybody in this world
Let's take a ride, hey-ho on Iron John

Jump on the train to nowhere
From now on you are free
After rising from the ashes
You'll become a mystery

Too many of those strange injections
Too many gazes at the sun
The lady smiled, ""Well that's the business:
Running after number one.""

For all their childish daydreams
You caught their falling stars
Just for the cheapest contracts
You signed your autograph

And if you started much too early, therefore
You stopped too late
Make sure no one can stop you now
Here comes the ultimate

Where once we were playin'

Made a hole in my chest, and
Counted the stars inside
And then I saw you out there
Strung out into eternity

And since the moon arose
She swallowed all memories
Insatiable hunger she bears
