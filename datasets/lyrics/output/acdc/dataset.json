    "lyrics": "Smilin' face and lovin' eyes\nBut you keep on tellin' me all those lies\nHow'd you expect me to believe?\nHoney, I ain't that naïve\nBaby, I've got my eye on you\n'Cause you do all the things I want you to\nStop your cryin' and dry your tears\nI ain’t that wet behind the ears\n\nAnd you can throw me lefts\nAnd you can throw me rights\nBut where was you last night?\nBeatin' around the bush\n\nWish I knew what's on your mind\nAnd why you're being so unkind\nRemember those nights we spent alone\nTalkin' on the telephone?\nThoughts of you go through my brain\nTold me that you felt the same\nDon't say that you love me too\nTell me, who would lie with you?\n\nI was talkin' birds\nAnd you was talkin' bees\nOr was he down upon his knees?\nBeatin' around the bush\nOw\n\nYou're the meanest woman I've ever known\nSticks and stones won't break my bones\nI know what you're lookin' for\nYou've eaten your cake, you want some more\nI'm gonna give you just one more chance\nTry to save our romance\nDone everythin' I'm gonna do\nThe rest is up to you\n\nAnd you can chew it up\nAnd you can spit it out\nLet it all hang out\nBeatin' around the bush\nOw\n\nChew it up\nSpit it out\nLet it all hang out\nBeatin' around the bush"
