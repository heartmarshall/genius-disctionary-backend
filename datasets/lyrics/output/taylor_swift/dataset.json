    "lyrics": "I walked through the door with you, the air was cold\nBut somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow\nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister's house\nAnd you've still got it in your drawer, even now\n\nOh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\nWe're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\nAnd I can picture it after all these days\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThat magic's not here no more\nAnd I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\nOh, oh, oh\n\n'Causе there we arе again on that little town street\nYou almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\nWind in my hair, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\nAnd your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\nYou taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys, \"Fuck the patriarchy\"\nKeychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\nAnd I was thinkin' on the drive down, \"Any time now\nHe's gonna say it's love,\" you never called it what it was\n'Til we were dead and gone and buried\nCheck the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\nAfter three months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\nBut all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\n\nAnd I know it's long gone and\nThere was nothing else I could do\nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\n\n'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we'd swear\nTo remember it all too well, yeah\n\nWell, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\nRunnin' scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again just to break me like a promise\nSo casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\nI'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\n'Cause I remember it all, all, all\n\nThey say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\nEvery time you double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\nAnd that made me want to die\nThe idea you had of me, who was she?\nA never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\nNot weepin' in a party bathroom\nSome actress askin' me what happened, you\nThat's what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\nAnd he said, \"It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one\"\n\nTime won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\nI'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\nAfter plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things and I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf from that very first week\n'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\nYou can't get rid of it\n'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\n\n'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\nBack before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there\nYou remember it all\nDown the stairs, you were there\nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\n\"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\"\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n'Cause in this city's barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it (All too well)\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nWind in my hair, I was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there, I was there\nSacred prayer, I was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it"

Were you a sleeper cell spy?\nIn fifty years, will all this be declassified?\nAnd you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, \"Good riddance\"\n'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden\nI would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside\nAnd you deserve prison, but you won't get time\nYou'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars\nYou crashed my party and your rental car\nYou said normal girls were boring\nBut you were gone by the morning\nYou kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing\n\nAnd in plain sight you hid\nBut you are what you did\nAnd I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive\nThe smallest man who ever lived"

    "lyrics": "Summer went away, still, the yearning stays\nI play it cool with the best of them\nI wait patiently, he's gonna notice me\nIt's okay, we're the best of friends\nAnyway\nI hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys\nI touch my phone as if it's your face\nI didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out\nThere's just one who could make me stay\nAll my days\n\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI waited ages to see you there\nI search the party of better bodies\nJust to learn that you never cared\n\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been\n\nI see the great escape, so long, Daisy May\nI picked the petals, he loves me not\nSomething different bloomed, writing in my room\nI play my songs in the parking lot\nI'll run away\n\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI called a taxi to take me there\nI search the party of better bodies\nJust to learn that my dreams aren't rare\n\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been\n\nFrom sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\nI gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this\nI hosted parties and starved my body\nLike I'd be saved by a perfect kiss\nThe jokes weren't funny, I took the money\nMy friends from home don't know what to say\nI looked around in a blood-soaked gown\nAnd I saw something they can't take away\n'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned\nEverything you lose is a step you take\nSo, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it\nYou've got no reason to be afraid\n\nYou're on your own, kid\nYeah, you can face this\nYou're on your own, kid\nYou always have been"

I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"
