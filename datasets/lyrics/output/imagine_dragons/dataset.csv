And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go

I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up

I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement
Oh, what a statement, love is embracement
Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
But keep on praying

Pain! You break me down, you build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without…
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without…

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
Believer, believer
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future
The blood in my veins-oh, ooh
The blood in my veins-oh, ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer
Pain! You break me down and build me up
