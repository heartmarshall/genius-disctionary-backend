Would I fall on the same knife?\nA rodeo queen breathing fire into the night\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, Brandi Carlile]\nWhat do you say we set the pleasantries aside?\nEven the diamonds look like rocks to the untrainеd eye\nWhat does it cost to buy your soul back whеn you die?\nWhat are the angels gonna do with you and I?\n\n[Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John]\nI\nWhat do the angels do with you and I?\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway?\n\n[Verse 3: Brandi Carlile & Elton John]\nThe color of the lie is white\nI would die on that hill in a one-handed fight\nIf you're not swingin' first you were never in the right\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, Brandi Carlile]\nWhat do you say we set the pleasantries aside?\nEven the diamonds look like rocks to the untrained eye\nWhat does it cost to buy your soul back when you die?\nWhat are the angels gonna do with you and I?\n\n[Chorus: Brandi Carlile & Elton John, Elton John]\nI\nWhat do the angels do with you and I?\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway? (Oh, no)\nBlame the end of days\nMercury in retrograde\nWho believes in angels anyway?\n\n[Verse 4: Brandi Carlile, Brandi Carlile & Elton John]\nThere's no need to curse the stars\nOr bite before you bark\nBut when you need someone to walk with in the dark\nI have been there\nI have been there\n\n[Outro: Brandi Carlile, Elton John, Both]\nI have been there\nI have been there\nMan, I've been there\nWoah, yeah, been there\nI've been there\nMan, I've been there\nI’ve been there\nI've been there\nI",

    "lyrics": "As I awoke this evening\nWith the smell of woodsmoke clinging\nLike a gentle cobweb hanging\nUpon a painted tepee\nOh, I went to see my chieftain\nWith my warlance and my woman\nFor he told us that the yellow moon\nWould very soon be leaving\n\nThis I can't believe I said\nI can't believe our Warlord's dead\nOh, he would not leave the chosen ones\nTo the buzzards and the soldiers' guns\n\nOh, great father of the Iroquois\nEver since I was young\nI've read the writing of the smoke\nAnd breast-fed on the sound of drums\nI've learned to hurl the tomahawk\nAnd ride a painted pony wild\nTo run the gauntlet of the Sioux\nTo make a chieftain's daughter mine\n\nAnd now you ask that I should watch\nThe red man's race be slowly crushed?\nWhat kind of words are these to hear\nFrom Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?\n\nI take only what is mine, Lord\nMy pony, my squaw, and my child\nI can't stay to see you die\nAlong with my tribe's pride\nI go to search for the yellow moon\nAnd the fathers of our sons\nWhere the red sun sinks in the hills of gold\nAnd the healing waters run\n\nTrampling down the prairie rose\nLeaving hoof tracks in the sand\nThose who wish to follow me\nI welcome with my hands\nI heard from passing renegades\nGeronimo was dead\nHe'd been laying down his weapons\nWhen they filled him full of lead\n\nNow there seems no reason why\nI should carry on\nIn this land that once was my land\nI can't find a home\nIt's lonely and it's quiet\nAnd the horse soldiers are coming\nAnd I think it's time I strung my bow\nAnd ceased my senseless running\nFor soon I'll find the yellow moon\nAlong with my loved ones\nWhere the buffaloes graze in clover fields\nWithout the sound of guns\nAnd the red sun sinks at last\nInto the hills of gold\nAnd peace to this young warrior\nComes with a bullet hole",
