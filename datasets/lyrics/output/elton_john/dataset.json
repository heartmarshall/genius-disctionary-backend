    "lyrics": "Oh, the joke was never hard to tell\nThrew my spare change in the wishing well\nThe dream alone is always in your hands\nIf that don't fill the boy and build the man\nA heart has many secrets, so I'm told\nThrough the years, a theory can grow cold\nI'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear\nThe voice inside my head is the one I hear\n\nSinging, I'm gonna love me again\nCheck in on my very best friend\nFind the wind to fill my sails\nRise above the broken rails\nUnbound by any ties that break or bend\nI'm free, and don't you know?\nNo clown to claim he used to know me then\nI'm free, and don't you know?\nAnd oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again\n\nHoo-ooh-ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nThe golden age was somehow bittersweet\nBut now the past lies sleepin' in the deep\nThe peaceful days that followed hollow nights\nA kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite\nPraise the Saints that hung up on my wall\nFor trust is left in lovers after all\nA whispered word emergin' from a tale\nMy wake-up call to claim the cursed spell\n\nWell, I'm gonna love me again (Love me again)\nCheck in on my very best friend\nFind the wind to fill my sails\nRise above the broken rails\nUnbound by any ties that break or bend\nI'm free, and don't you know?\nNo clown to claim he used to know me then\nI'm free, and don't you know?\nAnd oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again\n\nSing, I'm gonna love me again\nCheck in on my very best friend\nFind the wind to fill my sails\nRise above the broken rails\nUnbound by any ties that break or bend\nI'm free, and don't you know?\nNo clown to claim he used to know me then\nI'm free, don't you know?\nAnd oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again\n\nI'm gonna love me again\nI'm gonna love me again"

    "lyrics": "As I awoke this evening\nWith the smell of woodsmoke clinging\nLike a gentle cobweb hanging\nUpon a painted tepee\nOh, I went to see my chieftain\nWith my warlance and my woman\nFor he told us that the yellow moon\nWould very soon be leaving\n\nThis I can't believe I said\nI can't believe our Warlord's dead\nOh, he would not leave the chosen ones\nTo the buzzards and the soldiers' guns\n\nOh, great father of the Iroquois\nEver since I was young\nI've read the writing of the smoke\nAnd breast-fed on the sound of drums\nI've learned to hurl the tomahawk\nAnd ride a painted pony wild\nTo run the gauntlet of the Sioux\nTo make a chieftain's daughter mine\n\nAnd now you ask that I should watch\nThe red man's race be slowly crushed?\nWhat kind of words are these to hear\nFrom Yellow Dog, whom white man fears?\n\nI take only what is mine, Lord\nMy pony, my squaw, and my child\nI can't stay to see you die\nAlong with my tribe's pride\nI go to search for the yellow moon\nAnd the fathers of our sons\nWhere the red sun sinks in the hills of gold\nAnd the healing waters run\n\nTrampling down the prairie rose\nLeaving hoof tracks in the sand\nThose who wish to follow me\nI welcome with my hands\nI heard from passing renegades\nGeronimo was dead\nHe'd been laying down his weapons\nWhen they filled him full of lead\n\nNow there seems no reason why\nI should carry on\nIn this land that once was my land\nI can't find a home\nIt's lonely and it's quiet\nAnd the horse soldiers are coming\nAnd I think it's time I strung my bow\nAnd ceased my senseless running\nFor soon I'll find the yellow moon\nAlong with my loved ones\nWhere the buffaloes graze in clover fields\nWithout the sound of guns\nAnd the red sun sinks at last\nInto the hills of gold\nAnd peace to this young warrior\nComes with a bullet hole"
