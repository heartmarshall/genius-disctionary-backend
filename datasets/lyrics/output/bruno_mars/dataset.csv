I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico (Bih)
Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now, tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you?
(Is it you?)
Is it me?
(Is it me?)
Say it's us
(Say it's us)
and I'll agree, baby

Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Sex by the fire at night
Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

You say you want a good time
Well, here I am, baby, here I am, baby
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby
Tell me, what's on your mind? (What's on your mind?)
If you want it, girl, come and get it
All this is here for you
Tell me, baby, tell me, tell me, baby
What you tryna do?

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man"

No, don't be afraid to show it all
I'll be right here ready to hold you

Your head down to your heels

Oo, oo, ooo

Now I know, that I had to borrow
And beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin to keep ya, trying to please ya
Cause being in love with you ain't cheap

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(she's a gold digger just thought you should know sugar)
(just thought you should know )
Ooooooh
I've got some news for you
Ooh! I really hate you right now

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love and I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
Though there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo

Now baby, baby, baby, why'd you wanna wanna hurt me so bad?
(so bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my mamma but she told me
""this is one for your dad""
(your dad, your dad, your dad)
Uh! Whyyy? Uh! Whyyy? Uh!
Whyyy lady? Oh! I love you!! Oh!
I still love you!! Oooh..........!

I see you driving 'round town
With the girl I love, I'm like
Forget you
Oo, oo, ooo
I guess the change in my pocket
Wasn't enough I'm like
Forget you
And forget her too!
I said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Ha, now ain't that some shh (ain't that some shh)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best, I'm like
Forget you!
Oo, oo, ooo"

Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh

At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...

Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon

Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away"

Non-stop to the top
I bring you the cream of the crop
Silk Sonic!
Hmm-mm-mm-mm
Say baby, say baby, say baby (Let's ride)

What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
I just shaved, smooth like a newborn
Hmm, we should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through

Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Ah-ah), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got that haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be making (Shamone!)
I'm talking kissing, cuddling
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl, oo-ooh
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Let's go)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I need you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (I gotta see you, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Girl, I'm tryna give you this, ah)

Hey, hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
And I'm hopin', hopin'
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Woo!)

Hmm, I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
Girl, I'm here just waiting for you
Come on over, I'll adore you
La-la-la-la
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting for you, you
Come on over, baby
I'ma leave the door open for
You (Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo, woo-woo-woo-woo-woo)
You (Woo!)
Thank you"
