Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here, am I sitting in a tin can
Far, above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows

Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

Here, am I floating 'round my tin can
Far, above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do"

Goodbye, love

Didn't know what time it was; the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll, ""Lotta soul,"" he said
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive

There's a starman waitin' in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waitin' in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

He told me
""Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie""

I had to phone someone, so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on Channel Two
Look out your window, I can see his light
If we can sparkle, he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa, or he'll get us locked up in fright

There's a starman waitin' in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waitin' in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile

He told me

To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling, ""No!""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh, man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman, beating up the wrong guy
Oh, man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best-selling show
Is there life on Mars?

It's on America's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

But the film is a saddening bore
Because I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

Of how the others must see the faker

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still, the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through

Ch-ch-changes, don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes, turn and face the strange

You've left us up to our necks in it

Dropped my cell phone down below
Ain't that just like me?

By the time I got to New York
I was living like a king
There I used up all my money
I was looking for your ass

This way or no way, you know I'll be free

I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone

Now Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And the Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand, but made it too far
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes, and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man, well-hung and snow-white tan

So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz
With God-given ass, he took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (Ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

Oh yeah
Ooh

Then I knew he was not lying (Lying)

I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people

A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

Don't let the milk float ride your mind

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song

'Bout leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll

A pimp's got a Caddy and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for

New words that only they can share in

Through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross and baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love

Told of love and how my God on high is

Sue, the virgin on your stone
For your grave
Why, too dark to speak the words?
For I know that you have a son
Oh, folly, Sue

Ride the train, I'm far from home
In a season of crime none need atone
I kissed your face
Sue, I've pushed you down beneath the weeds
Endless faith in hopeless deeds
I kissed your face, I touched your face

Sue, goodbye

Sue, I found your note
That you wrote last night
It can't be right
You went with him
Sue, I never dreamed
I'm such a fool
Right from the start
You went with that clown"

They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying

I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name?
And you've been so long

And I've been putting out fire
With gasoline

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through
You've been so long
And it's been so long

And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out the fire
With gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been through​
You've been so long
Well, it's been so long

And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline
Putting out fire
With gasoline

(Been so long)
(Been so long) And it's been so long
(Been so long) I've been putting out fire
(Been so long) It's been so long
(Been so long) Been putting out fire
(Been so long) It's been so long
(Been so long) Putting out fire
(Been so long)
Been so long (So long, so long)
Been so long (So long, so long)
Been putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been putting out fire (Been so long, so long, so long)
Been so long
(Been so long, so long, so long)
(Been so long, so long so long)
Been putting out fire
Been putting out fire
Been so long
Been so long
And I've been putting out fire
I've been putting out fire"

She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul
Cologne she'll wear
Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn
Don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end
She will be your living end

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh"

That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland, full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

Fashion - Turn to the left
Fashion - Turn to the right
Ooh, fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me
No-Beep-Beep

There's a brand new talk but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and it's tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the dance floor
(Ooh, bop, fashion)

Fashion - Turn to the left
Fashion - Right
Fashion
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me
No-Beep-Beep - Beep-Beep
