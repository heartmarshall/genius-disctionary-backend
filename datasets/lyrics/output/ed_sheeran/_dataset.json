    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNow I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound\nPlaying a different show every night in front of a new crowd\nThat’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now\nSee me lose focus as I sing to you loud\nAnd I can’t, no, I won’t hush\nI’ll say the words that make you blush\nI’m gonna sing this now\nSee, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is\nI'm like glue I stick to other artists\nI'm not you, now that would be disastrous\nLet me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures\nSee, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me\nI’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy\nI won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free\nSuffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sing, \"I write my own tune and I write my own verse,\" hell\nDon't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell\nCall yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing\nName’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing\nI sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool\nI will blast and I didn't go to Brit school\nI came fast with the way I act, right\nI can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe\nAnd I won’t be a product of my genre\nMy mind will always be stronger than my songs are\nNever believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya\nAlways read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia\nMusically I’m demonstrating\nWhen I perform live, feels like I am meditating\nTimes at the enterprise when some fella filmed me\nA young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me man\n\n[Verse 3]\nAll I want in this cold world is to make music and use it\nNot to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music\nWho did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?\nChitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me\nAll I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely\nTo be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?\nHey, so I keep singing that\nWhen I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters\nBecame invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar\nAnd made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark\nAnd then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody\nHennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block\nWho said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?\nI'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy\nWith my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die\nSo see the signs, stand to the side\nOpen your eyes and take a look and realize\nThe resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears\nI arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar\nUrban Angel rising from the ashes\nSurprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bub\nMummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs\nInto having sex, I ain't into making love\nCome give me a hug if you're into getting rough\nYou can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly\nMummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs\nInto having sex, I ain't into making love\nCome give me a hug if you're into getting rough\n\n[Chorus]\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Bridge]\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning\nMy eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning\nMy eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade\nMy eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning\n\n[Verse 4]\nNow where I come from burning weed it is a habit\nA big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it\nCause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic\nCause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit\nYup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood\nOne of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should\nOne of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good\nBurning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel\nBut me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug\nAnd if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug\nWhere I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged\nWhere I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub\nWhere I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love\nWhere I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine\nI blaze high grade weed all the time!\n\n[Bridge]\nNow my eyes are red\nCause you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nAnd you need me, I don't need you\nYou need me man, my eyes are red\nYou need me man, I don't need you\nYou need me man, I don't need you\n\n[Instrumental break]\n\n[Interlude]\nWoooah\nWoooah\nWoooah\nYea\n\n[Verse 5]\nCause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right\nI won't stop until my name's in lights\nWith stadium heights, with Damian Rice\nOn red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights\nBecause I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice\nLong nighter, short height and I gone hyper\nNever be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah\nThe game's over but now I'm on a new level\nWatch how I step on the track without a loop pedal\nPeople think that I'm bound to blow up\nI've done around about a thousand shows but\nI haven't got a house plus I live on a couch\nSo you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out\nWow, from day one I've been prepared\nWith V05 wax for my ginger hair\nNow I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of\nWhat the future holds cause it's another day\n\n[Verse 6]\nRucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows\nI'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know\nOn tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant\nIf you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate\nMy flows developing, skin lacks the melanin\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\nDo it for the hell of it\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\nI took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image\nPut in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick\nThe fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\nWorld's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\nI'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing\nI'm back to sing this\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man\n\n[Verse 7]\nI'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic\nAnd I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it\nAnd replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift\nInto another rapper shoes using new laces\nI'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers\nSelling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors\nNationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back\nClean cut kid without a razor for the mustache\nI hit back, when the pen hurts me\nI'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee\nI'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though\nAccording to the MySpace and YouTube videos\nI'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio\nTruly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio\nMelody music maker, reading all the papers\nThey say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator\n\n[Chorus]\nCause you need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me, man, I don't need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you\nYou need me, man, I don’t need you at all\nYou need me man\nDon't need yu\n\n[Outro]\nCool…",
