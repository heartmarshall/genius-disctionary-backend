So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home

To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds

Lovin' can hurt sometimes

And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes

We keep this love in a photograph

Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul

I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya

Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone

I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

I threw the day-old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get-well-soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But, Mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

(Ooh)
(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""

Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band

Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (
Get lost
)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (
Get lost
)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

Sei la mia donna
La forza delle onde del mare
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
E siamo sempre bambini ma
Nulla è impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò

Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:
""Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me""

[Chorus 3:
Ed Sheeran
& Andrea Bocelli]
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre in noi
Perché sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
Quanto ti ho aspettato
Perché tu stasera, sei perfetta per me"

And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it ""gifted""

Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em

Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questionin' what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothin' could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're livin' your dream, man, this **** should be fun
Please, know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, tellin' me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two hundred and forty thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more, ah-yeah

Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away

And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow"

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about

Twenty-two grand kids now growin' old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was workin' on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearin' borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growin' old
Five sons and three daughters

From her snow-white streak in her jet-black hair
Over sixty years I've been lovin' her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know, Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

Love flows deeper than the river

Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey

Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

I sing, ""I write my own tune and I write my own verse,"" hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah

Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man

All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady

You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me

My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning

Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!

Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you

Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea

Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day

Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man

I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator

Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi

'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights at stadium heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over, but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus, I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa
Givin' a dose of what the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus, I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you"

That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, ""Remember that the answer's in the love that we create""
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away"

And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain

What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain

Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions, going through us

And, oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop

And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
(I feel it all over now, now, and I feel love)
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand-new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand-new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I

Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint

Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said,
""That's just the way things go""
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed

And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
