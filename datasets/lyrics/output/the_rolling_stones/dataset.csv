Yeow
Yeow

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah

I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When, after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
Oh yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Aww yeah
(Uh, get down heavy!)

Pleased to meet you, hope you'll guess my name
Aww yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game
Mmm yeah

Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
Mmm, yeah

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
Mmm, yeah
But what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
Mmm, mean it, get down

Woo hoo!
Aww yeah
Get on down
Oh yeah
Ba bum bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, ba ba bum, yeah

Tell me, baby, what's my name?
Tell me, honey, can you guess my name?
Tell me, baby, what's my name?
I'll tell you one time, you're to blame
Ooo hoo, ooo hoo, ooo hoo
All right
Ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo, ooo hoo hoo

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Mother needs something today to calm her down
And though she's not really ill
There's a little yellow pill

She goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And it helps her on her way
Gets her through her busy day

""Things are different today"", I hear every mother say
Cooking fresh food for her husband's just a drag
So she buys an instant cake
And she burns a frozen steak

And goes running for the shelter of her mother's little helper
And two help her on her way
Get her through her busy day

""Doctor, please some more of these""
Outside the door
She took four more
What a drag it is getting old

""Men just aren't the same today"", I hear every mother say
""They just don't appreciate that you get tired""
""They're so hard to satisfy""
You can tranquilize your mind

So go running for the shelter of a mother's little helper
And for help you through the night
Help to minimize your plight

She took four more
What a drag it is getting old

The pursuit of happiness just seems a bore
And if you take more of those
You will get an overdose
