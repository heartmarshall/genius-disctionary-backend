Yes and um, I’m with you, Derek, this star nonsense

Yes, yes

Now which is it?

I am sure of it

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here"

Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb

I have become comfortably numb

Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? (Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb"

*clocks ringing*

Ticking away
The moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours
In an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your hometown
Waiting for someone
Or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun

And you run, and you run
To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
And racing around
To come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older
Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

]

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells"

Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

Rode on the steel breeze

Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance, two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the Sun

Cloudless, every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
Call to you across the sky"

Gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
Then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

Wah! *laughter*

You gotta keep one eye
Looking over your shoulder
You know, it's gonna get harder, harder and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up, fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

*dogs barking and howling*

And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a
good drown as you go down
All alone, dragged down by the stone

(Stone, stone, stone, stone, stone, stone, stone...)
*dogs barking and howling*

Got to admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
This creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with collar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack? (Breaking away from the pack)
Who was only a stranger at home? (Only a stranger at home)
Who was ground down in the end? (Ground down in the end)
Who was found dead on the phone? (Found dead on the phone)
Who was dragged down by the stone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?"

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude the flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air

You better watch out
There may be dogs about
I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen
Things are not what they seem

What do you get for pretending the danger's not real?
Meek and obedient, you follow the leader
Down well trodden corridors into the valley of steel

What a surprise!
A look of terminal shock in your eyes
Now things are really what they seem
No, this is no bad dream

I shall not want
He makes me down to lie
Through pastures green He leadeth me the silent waters by
With bright knives, He releaseth my soul
He madeth me to hang on hooks in high places
He converteth me to lamb cutlets
For lo, He hath great power and great hunger
When cometh the day we lowly ones
Through quiet reflection and great dedication
Master the art of karate
Lo, we shall rise up
And then we'll make the bugger's eyes water

Bleating and babbling, we fell on his neck with a scream
Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha
Wave upon wave of demented avengers
March cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream

Have you heard the news?

You better stay home and do as you're told
Get out of the road if you want to grow old

A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earthbound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought, I'd thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds, I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies

In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)

Testing. One. Two. One. Two. The worms will convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going in force!

(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews

All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again

All you need to do is follow the worms

The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station, where we'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road
At that point, we'll be heading towards Lambeth Road, where we will walk calmly with resistance, leaving twelve minutes to three as we move along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge
Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge, we're in Westminster Borough area. It's quite possible that we may encounter some Jew boys all the way from 4, 5, and 6 on the way as we go
Now is the time to clean up the city, for this is the beginning! We need to secure our people! We can't stand around and let ourselves be robbed, maimed, and killed!
And when we make it to the Highclock Corner, I want you to spread out and find them!
Storm the halls, and then tear the walls and the doors! Break down the doors and hunt them where they are!
