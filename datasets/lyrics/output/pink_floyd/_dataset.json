    "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThrough the fish-eyed lens of tear-stained eyes\nI can barely define the shape of this moment in time\nAnd far from flying high in clear blue skies\nI'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide\nIf you negotiate the minefield in the drive\nAnd beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes\nAnd if you make it past the shotguns in the hall\nDial the combination, open the priest hole\nAnd if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)\n*Shot* (Yahoo!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a kid who had a big hallucination\nMaking love to girls in magazines\nHe wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith\nCould anybody love him\nOr is it just a crazy dream?\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd if I show you my dark side\nWill you still hold me tonight?\nAnd if I open my heart to you\nAnd show you my weak side,  what would you do?\nWould you sell your story to Rolling Stone?\nWould you take the children away and leave me alone?\nAnd smile in reassurance as you whisper down the phone?\nWould you send me packing?\nOr would you take me home?\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nThought I oughta bare my naked feelings\nThought I oughta tear the curtain down\nI held the blade in trembling hands\nPrepared to make it but...\nJust then the phone rang\nI never had the nerve to make the final cut\n\n[Outro]\n“Hello? Listen, I think I'm going insane.\"\n\"Okay, listen, it's a- Hahahaha!”",
