I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one, uh
Who will dance on the floor in the round?

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do,"" uh
""And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh, oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh, oh), hey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Woo)
Uh, she says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee; no, no)
(Hee-hee-hee, woo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee, uh, uh)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice (Don't think twice)
Do think twice (A-hoo)
She told my baby we danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do,"" uh
""And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Don't break no hearts; hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey

Billie Jean is not my lover (Woo)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son, uh
No-no-no, uh, no-no-no, no-no-no (Woo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No, no)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee-hee)
(Ah-hee-hee-hee)

Hee, hoo
(Chicka-boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom, chicka-boom)

She says I am the one, uh
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no, woo, uh)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no (No-no-no, ah), no-no-no-no (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (No, baby)
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no; woo, uh)

She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breakin' my heart, babe)
She says I am the one
Yeah, yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl)
Yeah, Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; don't call me Billie Jean, hoo)
Billie Jean is not my lover, uh (She is just a girl; she's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee), aaow, ooh
Yeah, Billie Jean is"

Think they can make it a better place

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
Make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares

We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

(Yeah) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
(Then) Make a better place for you and for me
(Everyone, there are) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

(
You and for me
) Make a better place
(You and for me) Make a better place
(You and for me) Make a better place
(You and for me) Heal the world we live in
(You and for me) Save it for our children
(You and for me) Heal the world we
live in
(You and for me) Save it for our children
(You and for me) Heal the world we live in

As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night

And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)

You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

Against the thing with forty eyes, girl

Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller (Ooh), thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

I'm gonna thrill you tonight (Thriller night)

The funk of forty thousand years (
Thriller night, thriller

And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na
Uh-huh

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream (Washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

And no message could have been any clearer

I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)

And no message (Ooh, ooh) could have been any clearer

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

Looking out across the nighttime

Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime

She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home, she didn't have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

She said she didn’t have no man (Ah, ah)

Lovin' me while she was still your wife (She was wantin' me)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school (She was lovin' me)
She said like it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can (She was wantin' me)
She'd lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah

Woah-oh-oh, no
Alright
Oh, I'm in love, love

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way

And all things have to change

She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright""

Diana walked up to me, she said, ""I'm all yours tonight""

Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
""You are my friend""
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Hey
Yeah
Mother
Oh, baby

Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human

Mother
Hey

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
You'll be there for me and
Care enough to bear me

Hold me (Show me), lay your head lowly (Told me)
Softly then boldly (Yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human), lead me (Hold me)
Love me and feed me (Yeah, yeah), kiss me and free me (Yeah)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human), carry (Carry)
Carry me boldly (Carry me), lift me up slowly (Yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human), save me (Lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (Lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me, ""I will be there"" (I will be there)
Lift me, lift me up slowly, carry me boldly (Yeah)
Show me you care (Yeah), hold me (Hoo)
Lay your head lowly (It gets lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly (I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there (Carry me there), need me (Hoo)
Love me and feed me (Lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me (Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed (Yeah)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart"

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last

Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed

Here, abandoned in my fame

Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything?
Seems like you'd know, by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get me (Come on, now)
And why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be
See, I'm too much for you, baby (Take on)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Doo, doo, dah
Oh, ah, well

Now, you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, ha, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake, baby, I've got what it takes (Yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get me (You can't do it, baby)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me? (Come on)

You can't believe it (I'm unbreakable), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (You can't touch me), 'cause I'm untouchable (Why do you do it, baby?)
And I know you hate it (Come on, now), and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me—
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here (Be here)
Through all your lies and silly games, I'ma still remain the same
I'm (
Uh, uh
) unbreakable (
What? Uh
)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Yeah), 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (You hate it), and you can't take it (Ooh)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, (Hoo, hoo, hoo), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (Yeah, ah), 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?), and you can't take it (Just why did you do it?)
You'll never break me—
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel, but I am

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

When I'm with you, I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently, I pray

Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)

I'm humbled in your grace

(Money) Lie for it, spy for it
Kill for it, die for it

So you call it trust, but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church, read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the ""Just Few""
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

If you show me the cash, then I will take it (Ah)
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it (Ah)
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil

Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? (Ah) I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your god is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it (Ah)
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it (Ah)
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)

Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
