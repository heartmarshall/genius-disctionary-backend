That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do ya?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"

I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Well you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razor blade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again

Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again"

To her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night beside her
And you know that she's half-crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
Then she gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said, ""All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them""
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind"

Be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified

A million candles burning
For the help that never came

Hineni, hineni

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle-class and tame
I didn't know I had permission
To murder and to maim
You want it darker

You were talking so brave and so sweet
Givin' me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
Those were the reasons, that was New York
We were runnin' for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Now but you got away, didn't you babe?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jivin' around

And I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again, you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music""

And then you got away didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jivin' around

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often"

I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now,  I hope you're keeping some kind of record

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear?

Oh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train
Then you came home without Lili Marlene
And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back, she was nobody's wife

Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer?
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way
If you ever come by here for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping and his woman is free

Yes, and thanks for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good, so I never tried
And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear

Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes

Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose
Everybody knows

And everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows

Everybody knows that it's me or you

Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still picking cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows

And everybody knows that the plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows

And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows

Everybody knows, everybody knows

Oh, everybody knows

Dance me to the end of love

Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh, dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, oh, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love

Break of day
Start again

Don't dwell on what
Has passed away
Or what is yet to be

Yeah, the wars
They will be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again
Bought and sold
And bought again
The dove is never free

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

We asked for signs
The signs were sent
The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah, the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see

I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned
They've summoned up a thundercloud
They're gonna hear from me

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

You can add up the parts
You won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart
Every heart to love will come
But like a refugee

Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering

Give me absolute control over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby, that's an order!

And stuff it up the hole in your culture
Give me back the Berlin Wall, give me Stalin and St. Paul

Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill, he'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet an old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger""

But now another stranger seems to want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before, his golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah you hate to watch another tired man lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep, you notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in, sit down, but something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road, it opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

""Well, I've been waiting, I was sure we'd meet between the trains we're waitin' for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter""
When he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after

""Let's meet tomorrow, if you choose, upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river""
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, ""Ok, the bridge or someplace later""

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And leaning on your window sill, he'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet an old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain, you must learn, learn to serve me well

You strike my side by accident as you go down for your gold
The cripple here that you clothe and feed is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company
Not at the center, the center of the world

When I am on a pedestal, you did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me to kneel grotesque and bare
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare

You who wish to conquer pain, you must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me, they're the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound

I have begun to long for you, I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you, I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe

Do not dress in those rags for me, I know you are not poor
And don't love me quite so fiercely now, when you know that you are not sure
It is your turn, beloved
It is your flesh that I wear"

Oh like a baby, stillborn

I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

She cried to me, ""Hey, why not ask for more?""

A thousand kisses deep

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me

I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked

Kept us hidden in the garret

Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long

Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control
It begins with your family, but soon it comes round to your soul
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned:
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

I don't like your fashion business, mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister

And I thank you for those items that you sent me
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready

Remember me, I brought your groceries in (ooh baby yeah)
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded (baby)

Who by very slow decay
And who shall I say is calling?

And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
And who by avalanche, who by powder
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
And who shall I say is calling?

And who by brave assent, who by accident
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Who in mortal chains, who in power
And who shall I say is calling?"

There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on it's jaws

Oh I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lily
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With it's very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging it's tail in the sea

There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears?

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz it's been dying for years

There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lilies of snow

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its ""I'll never forget you, you know!""

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ...
With its very own breath of brandy and death
Dragging its tail in the sea

And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist

Oh my love, Oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now. It's all that there is

From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
That it ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the war against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state!
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on...

It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
The river's going to weep
And the mountain's going to shout Amen!
It's coming like the tidal flood
Beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious
In amorous array
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A

Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state!
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on...

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
That time cannot decay
I'm junk but I'm still holding up
This little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A"

To make you jealous of me
But the room just filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And then I confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through

I showed my heart to the doctor
He said I just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin

I heard of a saint who had loved you
So I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Is to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

An Eskimo showed me a movie
He'd recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
Oh, please let me come into the storm"

Got something in my eye

And doesn’t need to die

Obscure and obsolete
Until witnessed here in time and blood

And I'm still working with the wine
Still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
But the heart will not retreat
I ran with Diz and Dante
I never had their sweep
But once or twice they let me play

When I was sick in bed
I suppose that he told you everything
That I keep locked away in my head
Your master took you travelling
Well at least that's what you said
And now do you come back to bring
Your prisoner wine and bread?

You met him at some temple
Where they take your clothes at the door
He was just a numberless man in a chair
Who'd just come back from the war
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair
And he hands you the apple core
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare
Of all the kisses we put on some time before

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk
With a collar of leather and nails
And he never once made you explain or talk
About all of the little details
Such as who had a word and who had a rock
And who had you through the mails
Now your love is a secret all over the block
And it never stops, not even when your master fails

And he took you up in his aeroplane
Which he flew without any hands
And you cruised above the ribbons of rain
That drove the crowd from the stands
Then he killed the lights in a lonely lane
And an ape with angel glands
Erased the final wisps of pain
With the music of rubber bands

And now I hear your master sing
You kneel for him to come
His body is a golden string
That your body is hanging from
His body is a golden string
My body has grown numb
O now you hear your master sing
Your shirt is all undone

And will you kneel beside this bed
That we polished so long ago
Before your master chose instead
To make my bed of snow?
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red
And you're speaking far too low
No, I can't make out what your master said
Before he made you go

And I think you're playing far too rough
For a lady who's been to the moon
I've lain by this window long enough
To get used to an empty room
And your love is some dust in an old man's cuff
Who is tapping his foot to a tune
And your thighs are a ruin, you want too much
Let's say you came back sometime too soon

I loved your master perfectly
And I taught him all that he knew
He was starving in some deep mystery
Like a man who is sure what is true
And I sent you to him with my guarantee
I could teach him something new
And I taught him how you would long for me
No matter what he said, no matter what you'd do

I believe that you heard your master sing
While I was sick in bed
I'm sure that he told you everything
I must keep locked away in my head
Your master took you travelling
Well at least that's what you said
And now do you come back to bring

That's a Jew's harp on the table, that's a crayon in his hand
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
Far past the stems of thumbtacks that still throw shadows on the wood
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen on the works of last year's man

I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
Oh, one by one she had to tell them that her name was Joan of Arc
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc, for treating me so well
And though I wear a uniform, I was not born to fight
All these wounded boys you lie beside, goodnight, my friends, goodnight

I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
Bethlehem the bridegroom, Babylon the bride
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me
And Bethlehem inflamed us both like the shy one at some orgy
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see the serpent eat its tail

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar and I hoist my axe again
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon and Cain was just the man
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering all its children back again

The rain falls down on last year's man
An hour has gone by and he has not moved his hand
But everything will happen if he only gives the word
The lovers will rise up and the mountains touch the ground
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down, amen, on the works of last year's man"

""Do you hate mankind for what they done to you?""
He said, ""Talk of love not hate, things to do, it's getting late
I've so little time and I'm only passin' through.""

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
(Come a little closer, friend)

I saw Adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand
I said ""Now you're out, what are you gonna do?""
""Plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little Cain
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passin' through, so are you""

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through

I was with Washington at Valley Forge, shivering in the snow
I said, ""How come the men here suffer like they do?""
""Men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passin' through""

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through

I was at Franklin Roosevelt's side on the night before he died
He said, ""One world must come out of world war two"" (ah, the fool)
""Yankee, Russian, white or tan,"" he said, ""a man is still a man
We're all on one road, and we're only passin' through""

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through
Let's do it one more time

Passin' through, passin' through
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue
Glad that I ran into you
Tell the people that you saw me passin' through"

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the Angel of Compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
It's closing time

Yeah the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:
It's closing time

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the Holy Spirit's crying, ""Where's the beef?""
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this:
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time

I swear it happened just like this:
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The Gates of Love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But Closing time, closing time

I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me:
You were in it for your beauty too
And I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like God to me
Declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah I missed you since our place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and it's once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights

Of closing time
The whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and it's once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time

Oh the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots

But I never called it art
I got my shit together
Meeting Christ reading Marx
Sure it failed my little fire
But it's bright the dying spark
Go tell the young messiah
What happens to the heart

There's a mist of summer kisses
Where I tried to double-park
The rivalry was vicious
And the women were in charge
It was nothing, it was business
But it left an ugly mark
So I've come here to revisit
What happens to the heart

I was selling holy trinkets
I was dressing kind of sharp
Had a pussy in the kitchen
And a panther in the yard
In the prison of the gifted
I was friendly with the guard
So I never had to witness
What happens to the heart

I should have seen it coming
You could say I wrote the chart
Just to look at her was trouble
It was trouble from the start
Sure we played a stunning couple
But I never liked the part
It ain't pretty, it ain't subtle
What happens to the heart

Now the angel's got a fiddle
And the devil's got a harp
Every soul is like a minnow
Every mind is like a shark
I've opened every window
But the house, the house is dark
Just say Uncle, then it's simple
What happens to the heart

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
The slaves were there already
The singers chained and charred
Now the arc of justice bending
And the injured soon to march
I lost my job defending
What happens to the heart

I studied with this beggar
He was filthy he was scarred
By the claws of many women
He had failed to disregard
No fable here no lesson
No singing meadowlark
Just a filthy beggar blessing
What happens to the heart

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
I could lift, but nothing heavy
Almost lost my union card
I was handy with a rifle
My father's .303
We fought for something final
Not the right to disagree

Sure it failed my little fire
But it's bright the dying spark
Go tell the young messiah
What happens to the heart

I said to myself, ""Where are you golden boy, where is your famous golden touch?""
I thought you knew where all of the elephants lie down
I thought you were the crown prince of all the wheels in Ivory Town
Just take a look at your body now, there's nothing much to save
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries, ""Hey, Prince, you need a shave.""
Now if you can manage to get your trembling fingers to behave
Why don't you try unwrapping a stainless steel razor blade?

That's right, it's come to this, yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down?
Wasn't it a strange way down?

There's no hot water and the cold is running thin
Well, what do you expect from the kind of places you've been living in?
Don't drink from that cup, it's all caked and cracked along the rim
That's not the electric light, my friend, that is your vision growing dim
Cover up your face with soap there, now you're Santa Claus
And you've got a gift for anyone who will give you his applause
I thought you were a racing man, ah, but you couldn't take the pace
That's a funeral in the mirror and it's stopping at your face

That's right, it's come to this, yes it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Ah, wasn't it a strange way down?

Once there was a path and a girl with chestnut hair
And you passed the summers picking all of the berries that grew there
There were times she was a woman, oh, there were times she was just a child
And you held her in the shadows where the raspberries grow wild
And you climbed the twilight mountains and you sang about the view
And everywhere that you wandered, love seemed to go along with you
That's a hard one to remember, yes, it makes you clench your fist
And then the veins stand out like highways all along your wrist

And yes, it's come to this, it's come to this
And wasn't it a long way down
Wasn't it a strange way down?

You can still find a job, go out and talk to a friend
On the back of every magazine, there are those coupons you can send
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, they will give you back your hope
You can find your love with diagrams on a plain brown envelope
But you've used up all your coupons except the one that seems
To be written on your wrist along with several thousand dreams
Now Santa Claus comes forward, that's a razor in his mit
And he puts on his dark glasses and he shows you where to hit
And then the cameras pan the stand in stunt man

It's just the dress rehearsal rag
You know this dress rehearsal rag

I said to Hank Williams, ''How lonely does it get?''
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh, a hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgement coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window

As she came riding through the dark
No moon to keep her armor bright
No man to get her through this very smoky night

To wear upon my swollen appetite""

Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine

""And who are you?"" she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke
""Why, I'm fire"", he replied
""And I love your solitude, I love your pride""

To be his one, to be his only bride

And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress

It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of Joan of Arc
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood

I saw the glory in her eye
Myself, I long for love and light
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?

My father he came in
I was nine years old
And he stood so tall above me
Blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold
Said, ""I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told""
So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his ax was made of gold

Well, the trees they got much smaller
The lake a lady's mirror
We stopped to drink some wine
Then he threw the bottle over
Broke a minute later
And he put his hand on mine
Thought I saw an eagle
But it might have been a vulture
I never could decide
Then my father built an altar
He looked once behind his shoulder
He knew I would not hide

You who build the altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore
A scheme is not a vision
And you never have been tempted
By a demon or a god
You who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before
When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word

And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I inquire
""Just according to whose plan?""
When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will help you if I can
When it all comes down to dust
I will help you if I must
I will kill you if I can

""I never even knew how much I wanted you,"" she said
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete
""O baby, I have come too late."" She knelt beside his feet

""I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.""
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost

Now the master of this landscape he was standing there at the view
With a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood
She said, ""I'll make a place between my legs I'll show you solitude.""

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind
And the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine --
""This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.""

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track
She said, ""The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.""
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance
She mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache

Now the last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get
A woman's education but he's not a woman yet
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy
Who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed
It would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star
I guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far"

Her hair the black that black can go
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft, she answered no

I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold can be
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
""Follow me,"" the wise man said
But he walked behind

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all

Morning came and then came noon
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break

One morning I woke up alone
The hospital and the nurses gone
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone

I ate and ate and ate
No, I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate

I spent my hatred everyplace
On every work, on every face
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace

Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again

I was handsome, I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong

Who is it whom I address?
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest

Oh teachers, are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?"

I'm sorry you're tired
The evening has hardly begun

Thanks for the dance
Try to look inspired
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

There is a rose in your hair
Your shoulders are bare
You've been wearing this costume forever
So turn up the music
Pour out the wine
Stop at the surface
The surface is fine
We don't need to go any deeper

Thanks for the dance
I hear that we're married
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
Thanks for the dance
And the baby you carried
It was almost a daughter or a son

And there's nothing to do
But to wonder if you
Are as hopeless as me
And as decent
We're joined in the spirit
Joined at the hip
Joined in the panic
Wondering if
We've come to some sort
Of agreement

It was fine, it was fast
We were first, we were last
In line at the
Temple of Pleasure
But the green was so green
And the blue was so blue
I was so I
And you were so you
The crisis was light
As a feather

Thanks for the dance
It was hell, it was swell, it was fun
Thanks for all the dances
One-two-three, one-two-three, one"
