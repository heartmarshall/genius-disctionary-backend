    "lyrics": "[Verses 1 + 2]\nAh the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread\n\"I never even knew how much I wanted you,\" she said\nHis muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete\n\"O baby, I have come too late.\" She knelt beside his feet\n\n\"I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come\nI'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love.\"\nAnd all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust\nShe took unto herself most everything her lover lost\n\n[Bridge 1]\nNow the master of this landscape he was standing there at the view\nWith a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to\nShe beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood\nShe said, \"I'll make a place between my legs I'll show you solitude.\"\n\n[Verses 3 + 4]\nHe offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room\nHe promised her protection for the issue of her womb\nShe moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon\nShe stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon\n\nShe took his much admired oriental frame of mind\nAnd the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind\nShe took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine --\n\"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine.\"\n\n[Verse 5]\nHe tried to make a final stand beside the railway track\nShe said, \"The art of longing's over and it's never coming back.\"\nShe took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance\nShe mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache\n\n[Bridge 2]\nNow the last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get\nA woman's education but he's not a woman yet\nAnd the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy\nWho gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy\n\n[Verse 6]\nSo the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed\nIt would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed\nIt's like our visit to the moon or to that other star\nI guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far\n\nIt's like our visit to the moon or to that other star\nI guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far\n\nIt's like our visit to the moon or to that other star\nI guess you go for nothing if you really wanna go that far",
