Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while

The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny

What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go? (Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't
And why, I just don't know

Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers all the time

Sometimes, I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers

Slipping through my fingers all the time
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile"

Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene

Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Mmm, where they play the right music
Getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh, yeah

You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah

Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My, my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My, my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, woah

Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye-bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again

Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms, thinkin' I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (Yes, it's plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain?)

But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside, you must know I miss you
But what can I say? Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide (
They decide
)
The likes of me abide (
We abide
)
Spectators of the show (
Of the show
)
Always stayin' low (
Staying low
)
The game is on again (
On again
)
A lover or a friend (
Or a friend
)
A big thing or a small (
Big or small
)
The winner takes it all (
Takes it all
)

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

So the winner takes it all
And the loser has to fall
Throw a dice, cold as ice
Way down here, someone dear
Takes it all, has to fall
Yes, it's plain, why complain?"

You're enchained by your own sorrow
In your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow
How I hate to see you like this
There is no way you can deny it
I can see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, tell me the truth
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
You were always sure of yourself
Now I see you've broken a feather (How it hurts to see you cry and how it hurts to see you sad)
I hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you (Even though you cry, the sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before (So let me hear you sing some more the way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
And your love's a blown out candle
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh, so sad, so quiet

Chiquitita, you and I know
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving (You and I, we know, how all the heartaches come and go)
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end (You'll be dancing once again and all the pain you take will end)
You will have no time for grieving
Chiquitita, you and I cry
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you (Even though you cry, the sun is shining in the sky)
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before (So let me hear you sing some more the way you used to do before)
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Try once more, like you did before
Sing a new song, Chiquitita"

And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I

Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die

If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing

How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowin' outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm livin' in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

There's not a soul out there

Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando

Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

Last night, I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought, maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day, you'll find out he wears a disguise

And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder, does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day, you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Crazy 'bout his angel eyes

He took my heart and now I pay the price

The feeling right, the Paris night did its best to please us
And strolling down the Élysée
We had a drink in each café
And you, you talked of politics, philosophy
And I smiled like Mona Lisa

We had our chance
It was a fine and true romance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer, memories that remain

We made our way along the river
And we sat down in the grass by the Eiffel tower
I was so happy we had met
It was the age of no regret, oh, yes
Those crazy years, that was the time of the flower-power

But underneath, we had a fear of flying
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying
We took the chance like we were dancing our last dance

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, 'round the Notre Dame
Our last summer walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants, our last summer
Morning croissants
Living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer, we could laugh and play

And now you're working in a bank
The family man, a football fan
And your name is Harry
How dull it seems
Yet, you're the hero of my dreams

I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain
Our last summer, memories that remain
I can still recall our last summer
I still see it all
In the tourist jam, 'round the Notre Dame
Our last summer walking hand in hand
Paris restaurants, our last summer
Morning croissants
We were living for the day, worries far away
Our last summer"

Will you leave me standing in the hall
Or let me enter?

Take it easy, take it easy
Better slow down, girl

Does your mother know?
Take it easy, take it easy
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow

I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile
Smile, but girl, you're only a child

Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?

Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me

There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down? (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you? (Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game

I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me

Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?

I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why

Deep inside, both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

In our lives, we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn, but dignified, and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

It's so strange, when you're down, and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done

Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry anymore when all is said and done"

My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper goin' into town
And havin' gotten through the editorial, no doubt, I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after 9:00
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past 12:00 or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this, I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past 2:00
And at the time, I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At 5:00, I must have left, there is no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again, undoubtedly, I must have read the evening paper then
Oh, yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at 8:00 o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after 10:00
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while, the latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light, I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof, I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came"

For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share

I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far

Do I have it in me?

We do have it in us

The joy and the sorrow
We have a story
And it survived
And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage
Is everything

It all comes down to love

So keep an eye on Dan (Keep an eye on Dan)
And don't forget (And don't forget)
I'll be back at seven on Sunday to get him

I, I think he must have lost some weight
Funny how it takes me back to our first date
So keep an eye on Dan

Keep an eye on Dan
You're a loving man
Make an effort not to upset him
Just keep an eye on Dan (Keep an eye on Dan)
And don't forget (I won't forget to come back on Sunday to get him)
I'll be back on Sunday to get him
So keep an eye on Dan"

The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady

And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous, but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""That's all very fine
Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""

And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean

You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady

And with no trace of hesitation, she keeps going

Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
(She's one of those who always has to do whatever she please)
And she goes head over heels"

Now I'm under their spell
I love hearing the stories that they tell

They've seen places beyond my land
And they've found new horizons
They speak strangely but I understand

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

As all good friends we talk all night
And we fly wing to wing
I have questions and they know everything

There's no limit to what I feel
We climb higher and higher
Am I dreaming or is it all real?

Is it true I'm an eagle?
Is it true I can spread my wings?

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please

And I dream I'm an eagle
And I dream I can spread my wings

Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please
Flying high, high
I'm a bird in the sky
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze
High, high
What a feeling to fly
Over mountains and forests and seas
And to go anywhere that I please"

My resistance running low
And every day the hold is getting tighter
And it troubles me so (You know that I'm nobody's fool)
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me
I don't have a strategy
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart?
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to? I'm not sure I would know how (How, how)

And this is getting crazy, I should tell him so
Really let my anger show
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite, ""No"" (I'm kind of flattered I suppose)
Guess I'm kind of flattered, but I'm scared as well
Something like a magic spell
I hardly dare to think of what would happen, where I'd be if I fell

Under attack, I'm being taken
About to crack, defences breaking
Won't somebody please have a heart
Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover
He's on my track, my chasing lover
Thinking nothing can stop him now
Should I want to? I'm not sure I would know how (How, how)

Come and rescue me now 'cause I'm falling apart
Under attack, I'm taking cover"

Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

The city is a prison, you'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

And if I meet you, what if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger, tiger, tiger"

Me recuerda tiempo atrás, estrellas y una noche allá
En la lumbre azul, Fernando
Tarareabas tu canción con ese suave guitarrear
Yo podía escuchar esos tambores con un sordo redoblar

Se acercaban más, Fernando
Y el momento que pasaba parecía eternidad
Y sentí temor, Fernando
Por la vida y juventud, nadie pensaba en morir
Y no siento hoy vergüenza al confesar que tuve ganas de llorar

Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensábamos jamás perder ni echar atrás
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer, lo haría ya, Fernando

La vejez llegó, Fernando
Y con ella, una paz que hoy logramos disfrutar
Se durmió el tambor, Fernando
Pareciera que fue ayer que lo vivimos tú y yo
Y en tus ojos veo aún aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor

Algo había alrededor, quizá, de claridad, Fernando
Que brillaba por nosotros dos, en protección, Fernando
No pensabámos jamás perder ni echar atrás

The sound so ominously tearing through the silence
I cannot move, I'm standing
Numb and frozen
Among the things I love so dearly
The books, the paintings and the furniture
Help me

The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the doorknob
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient
And they don't dare to come here
Anymore now
But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up

These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting

In a terror ever-growing

And you told me, ""I'll return next year""
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here

So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

So is the outside world as you imaginеd?
Was it worth it severing the tiеs?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes

So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the village fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me?

When you danced with me
I miss the good old times when you danced with me"
