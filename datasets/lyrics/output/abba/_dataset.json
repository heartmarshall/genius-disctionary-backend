(Slipping through my fingers all the time)\nWell, some of that we did, but most we didn't\nAnd why, I just don't know\n\n[Chorus]\nSlipping through my fingers all the time\nI try to capture every minute\nThe feeling in it\nSlipping through my fingers all the time\nDo I really see what's in her mind?\nEach time I think I'm close to knowing\nShe keeps on growing\nSlipping through my fingers all the time\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes, I wish that I could freeze the picture\nAnd save it from the funny tricks of time\nSlipping through my fingers\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Outro]\nSlipping through my fingers all the time\nSchoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning\nWaving goodbye with an absent-minded smile",
