What the hell is the catch? It’s\nThe feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light\nIt’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?\nThe conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes\nEv’rything we said in total agreement, it’s\nA dream and it’s a bit of a dance\nA bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance\nHe’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance\nI asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?\nHis hands started fidgeting, he looked askance\nHe’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants\n\nHandsome, boy, does he know it!\nPeach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!\nI wanna take him far away from this place\nThen I turn and see my sister’s face and she is\n\nHelpless\nAnd I know she is\nHelpless\nAnd her eyes are just\nHelpless\nAnd I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time\n\nI’m a girl in a world in which\nMy only job is to marry rich\nMy father has no sons so I’m the one\nWho has to social climb for one\nCause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in\nNew York City is insidious\nAnd Alexander is penniless\nHa! That doesn’t mean I want him any less\n\n(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)\n(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)\n(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)\n\nHe’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister\nAnd that elevates his status, I’d\nHave to be naïve to set that aside\nMaybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza\nNow that’s his bride\nNice going, Angelica, he was right\nYou will never be satisfied\n\n(I will never be satisfied)\n(I will never be satisfied)\n\nI know my sister like I know my own mind\nYou will never find anyone as trusting or as kind\nIf I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned\nHe’d be mine\nShe would say, “I’m fine”\nBut she’d be lying\n\nBut when I fantasize at night\nIt’s Alexander’s eyes\nAs I romanticize what might have been\nIf I hadn’t sized him up so quickly\nAt least my dear Eliza’s his wife\nAt least I keep his eyes in my life…\n\nTo the groom!\n(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)\nTo the bride!\n(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)\nFrom your sister\n(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)\nWho is always by your side\n(By your side, by your side)\nTo your union and the hope that you provide\n(You provide, you provide)\n\nMay you always\nBe satisfied\nAnd I know (yeah)\nShe’ll be happy as his bride\nAnd I know\nHe will never be satisfied\nI will never be satisfied"
