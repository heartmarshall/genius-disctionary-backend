Help me, I'm holdin' on for dear life
Won't look down, won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until mornin' light

Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted, I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you

And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)
May you always (always)
Be satisfied (Rewind)

Rewind!
Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that—

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,”
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game…

You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself
You’re like me, I’ve never been satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name's Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant, there’s a million things I haven’t done
Just you wait, just you wait...

So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance
He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants

Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is

Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time

I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)
(Doesn’t mean I want him any less)

He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
And that elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

(I will never be satisfied)
(I will never be satisfied)

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”
But she’d be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

To the groom!
(To the groom, to the groom, to the groom)
To the bride!
(To the bride, to the bride, to the bride)
From your sister
(Angelica, Angelica, Angelica)
Who is always by your side
(By your side, by your side)
To your union and the hope that you provide
(You provide, you provide)

May you always
Be satisfied
And I know (yeah)
She’ll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied"

And now you push
To find a label that fits me
I'm feelin' good on a Wednesday
With my sparklin' thoughts

Help me unload the car
Ya! Ya! Ya!

And so I push
To close the door
Of the stall you've made for me
To keep me away!
And now we push (Push!)
To stand together
Because I am Lorde!

You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said, ""Me and you against the world""
You said, ""You and me forever, girl""
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but

I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

No, I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No, I won't stand for it, no, I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

I'd rather walk alone, r-r-rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
You said, ""I'm hangin' with the boys""
You said, ""Workin' late to pay our bills""
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color

I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

I'd fallen through the floor again, crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon, I couldn't even get up to turn the lights on
The dark was swallowing me

Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down, and I saw

Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand

Oh, I forgot the things I knew, it was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side, picked me up when I thought I would die
You held me and I was found

Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can't trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
And I'm breaking down

Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand"

Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening

No one's moving, we lack the courage to
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would
But we're too tired, we let the embers cool

There's no more fighting for us

Fill the void in our bed

Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking

No more fighting, we've given up now
Silence says more than words
Imagination cures loneliness
When you become a prisoner
