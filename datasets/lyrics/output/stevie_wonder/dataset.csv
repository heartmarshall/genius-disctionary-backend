And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Always)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Always)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you"

I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love"

No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart
I just called to say I love you, yeah
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Of my heart, of my heart

Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do, do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do

Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (
You nasty boy
)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?"

With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over

Can't you feel it all over?

You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people, go"

There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say, ""Come back some other day""

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, overloved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, overloved, over me

And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For, in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You, too, like I
Overjoyed, overloved, over you
Over you"

A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years.
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell, nig​ger.
God, Lord.

His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel, nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city

It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park, I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight, there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

You ask me, am I happy?
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you

Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no, no, no, baby, baby
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Na, no, na na, na na na
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
No, no, no, baby, nobody told you, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn

I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that you'd be jammin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, oh
You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makings of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers

Have a male friend to ask for me

And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange

You don't know, never know

I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart
Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

Came on tracking that was laid

Helped lead Lewis and Clark
Was a red woman

We love you

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time that you're near to me, baby?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to make a dream come true
So they sprinkled moondust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes, so true
And that is why I—

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
It seems to follow me wherever I go
(Doo-doo-dow-wua)
It says, ""Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more""
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go

I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No-no-no, no-no-no
No-no-no

I never can say goodbye…"

Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go

All the bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I've longed to go
So long
Away from tears

Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
And they won't go when I go

Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
'Cause they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I've longed to go
So long
Away from tears

Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He will give, he will give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah

The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
And they won't go when I go

Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go

And I'll go
Where I'll go
No one can keep me from
My destiny, yeah

They won't go where I go

That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand

She uses love to keep him strong

It's time to do what we have to do

That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

That's why I know I'll tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love now

I love her
And I want her
And my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to

I love her
I want her

Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms

Would make hell's fire seem like a spark

Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know

But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back

Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say

The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

But all is fair in love
I had to go away

To write the words again
That all in love is fair

All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play

But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side

You'd have more than one place to go""

Take your hat off to the man
Who's got the plan, yeah, yeah

Everybody tip your hat, now
To the man who's got the plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man
Let you know he's got the plan

Give a hand to the man
That you know darn well has got the super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Give a hand to the man that
You know damn well's got the super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All

If we had less of him
Don't you know we'd have a better land?
He's Misstra Know-It-All, hey, hey
So give a hand to the man
Although you've given out as much as you can
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Hey, you talk too much
You worry me to death, hey
He's Misstra Know-It-All
He's some kind of fella
Thinking of only himself
He's Misstra Know-It-All

Give a hand to the man
That you know has got a super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All

But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day
To love her for what she is, mmm
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head

Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that
She will get by with a dream?
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours
Starting to cry

But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well (Very well)
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you, too, very well
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well (Very well)
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head
(Your filthy head)
Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me, too, very well (Very well)
And I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well, dum dum da, dum da, dum da
Dum dum da, dum da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

When the summer came, you were not around
Now the summer's gone, and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?

When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you like right now?

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past

When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you–last winter, my love?
Oh, I need you, baby, I need you, baby

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past, oh

Spring will fill the air, you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you like right now?
Right now, right now, right now
Oh...
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear?
I need you, baby, I need you, baby, I need you, baby
I needed you, baby, I needed you, baby, I needed you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter?
Yeah, need you, baby, need you, need you, baby
Oh, you want me to need you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last? Dear, yeah..."

Made life's history
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears

I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming far and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring

Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the street
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me, would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walkin' away, you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over, in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back?
Takin' that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart
Your heart
In your heart
In your heart

You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a playboy, you said no (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind, you will blow (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But then it blew you out the box (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool, I know you feel (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy, there must be pain (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did, I've got to play (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott-free without some pain from me (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music, I can't dance (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story, sob-sad (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
About you blowing what you had (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Since one ain't good enough for you (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
Then do yourself, see how you do (Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)
(Ordinary pain, ordinary pain)

To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages, all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought or sold
Tell me, why are you people so cold?

I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women, and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow moonbeams and orange snow

People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars, 'cause we've learned to fly

Just to live to us is our natural high

Don't do that (Let her go first)
Let her go first, please let her go first (Let me go first, go 'head)

Okay, then we gon' take turns
Alright

And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased

When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind
