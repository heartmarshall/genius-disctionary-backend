When two hearts are caring
Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment we kissed
The night of the hayride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While taking a sleigh ride

Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call that tied up the line
For hours and hours
The Saturday dance, I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers

Magic moments
Memories we've been sharing
Magic moments
When two hearts are caring
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The way that we cheered
Whenever our team was scoring a touchdown
The time that the floor fell out of my car
When I put the clutch down

The penny arcade, the games that we played
The fun and the prizes
The Halloween hop when everyone came
In funny disguises

Magic moments
Filled with love"

And so I came to see her and listen for a while
And there she was this young girl, a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
I felt she found my letters and read each one out loud
I prayed that she would finish but she just kept right on

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song

She sang as if she knew me in all my dark despair
And then she looked right through me as if I wasn't there
But she was there, this stranger, singing clear and strong

Strumming my pain with her fingers
Singing my life with her words
Killing me softly with her song
Killing me softly with her song
Telling my whole life with her words
Killing me softly with her song"

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made of coal

Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale, they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around!

Oh, frosty, the snowman
Was alive as he could be;
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty, clumsy as he can be
See him lopping along!
Off he goes on an icicle spree
With a happy song!

Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, ""let's run, and we'll have some fun
Now, before I melt away.""

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Runnin' here and there
All around the square
Sayin', ""catch me if you can.""

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop . .
And only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""stop!""

Hmm, frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye, sayin' ""don't you cry
I'll be back again some day.""

Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump . .
Look at frosty go!
Thumpety, thump thump, thumpety, thump thump . .
Over the hills of snow!"

The day you took my hand

How lonely life can be

And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once the page is read
All but life is dead
That is my belief

On your own front door

A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

Now there's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart

To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start?

With her first hello!
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart

She fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With her along, who could be lonely?
I reach for her hand, it's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away
And she'll be there

She'll be there"

Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day

When Mother sat me down
And taught me to spell 'Christmas' this way:

'C' is for the Christ child, born upon this day
'H' for herald angels in the night
'R' means our Redeemer
'I' means Israel
'S' is for the star that shone so bright
'T' is for three wise men, they who travelled far
'M' is for the manger where He lay
'A' 's for all He stands for
'S' means Shepard's came

I wonder if the world's to blame
I wonder if it could be me

Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky

E'er tempt thy child to wander far
From Virtue's path away
When thorns beset life's devious way
And darkling waters flow
Then Mary aid thy weeping child
Thyself a mother show

Honest I do, you are so sweet
If I could just hold your charms
Again in my arms
Then, life would be complete!

Since you've been gone, dear
Life don't seem the same
Please come back again!

And after all's said an' done
There's only one
Girl of my dreams, it's you!

Since you've been gone, dear
Life don't seem the same
Please come back again!

And after all's said an' done
There's only one
Girl of my dreams, it's you!"

Tryin' to forget my
Feelings of love

Teardrops, rollin' down on my face
Tryin' to forget my
Feelings of love

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I'd never met you girl
You'll never come again
(You'll never come again, never, never)

Feelings, oh oh oh feelings
Oh oh oh feel you
Again in my arms (Again, again)

(Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never held you again in my arms)

Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I'd never met you girl
You'll never come again
(You'll never come again, never, never)

Feelings, oh oh oh feelings
Oh oh oh feel you
Again in my arms (Again, again)

Again in my arms!"
