Jealous and crazy?\nOr like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately\nI'd rather be crazy\n\nHold up, they don't love you like I love you\nSlow down, they don't love you like I love you\nBack up, they don't love you like I love you\nStep down, they don't love you like I love you\nCan't you see there's no other man above you?\nWhat a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you\nHold up, they don't love you like I love you\nOh, down, they don't love you like I love you\n\nI hop up out my bed and get my swag on\nI look in the mirror, say, \"What's up?\"\nWhat's up, what's up, what's up\nI hop up out my bed and get my swag on\nI look in the mirror, say, \"What's up?\"\nWhat's up, what's up, what's up"
