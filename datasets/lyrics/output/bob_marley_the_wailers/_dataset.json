Ride, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there\nBecause now the fire is out of control\nPanic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold\nEverywhere this fire is burning\nDestroying and melting their gold\nDestroying and wasting their souls\n\nRide, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there\n\n[Verse 4]\nTell you what: now the people gather on the beach\nAnd the leader try to make a speech\nBut the Dreadies understanding that it's too late\nFire is burning\nMan, pull your own weight\nFire is burning\nMan, pull your own weight\nNatty Dread rides again\nAnd me saying Go there, Dready\nOh ride, Natty, ride\nAnd go there, Dready\nRiding through the storm\nRiding through the calm\n\n[Outro]\nOh ride, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there",
