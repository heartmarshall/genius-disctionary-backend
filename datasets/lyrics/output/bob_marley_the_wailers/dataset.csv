Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty

These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

Mr. Brown is a clown
Who rides through town in a coffin
(Where can he be found?)
In the coffin where there is three crows on top
And two is laughing

Oh, what a confusion, ooh, yeah, yeah
What a botheration, ooh, now, now
Who is Mr. Brown? I wanna know now
He is nowhere to be found

From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown

I wanna know who (Is Mr. Brown?)
Is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?

Oh, calling duppy conqueror
I'm the ghost catcher
This is your chance
Oh, big, big Bill bull-bucka
Take your chance
Prove yourself, oh yeah

Down in parade
People running like a masquerade
The police make a raid
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, think it fade

What a thing in town
Crows, chauffeur-driven around
Skanking as if they had never known
The man they call Mr. Brown
I can tell you where he's from now

From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown..."

And he's got to fulfill that mission
To see his hurt is their greatest ambition
But we will survive in this world of competition
'cause no matter what they do
Natty keep on comin' through
And no matter what they say-ay
Dready di deh every day
Natty Dread rides again
Through the mystics of tomorrow
Natty Dread rides again
Have no fear, have no sorrow

All and all you see a-gwan
Is to fight against the Rastaman
So they build their world on great confusion
To force on us the devil's illusion
But the stone that the builder refuse
Shall be the head cornerstone
And no matter what game they play
We've got something they could never take away
We've got something they could never take away

And it's the fire, it's the fire
That's burning down everything
Feel the fire, fire
Only the birds have their wings
No time to be deceived
Oh, brothers, you should know and not believe
Jah say this judgement - it could never be with water
No water can put out this fire
This fire, this fire, this fire
A yaga y'all! Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there
Because now the fire is out of control
Panic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold
Everywhere this fire is burning
Destroying and melting their gold
Destroying and wasting their souls

Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there

Tell you what: now the people gather on the beach
And the leader try to make a speech
But the Dreadies understanding that it's too late
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Natty Dread rides again
And me saying Go there, Dready
Oh ride, Natty, ride
And go there, Dready
Riding through the storm
Riding through the calm

Oh ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there"

We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we won't bow
Neither can't be bought nor sold
We all defend the right, Jah, Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold

Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

I and I will see you through

We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

I and I will see you through

The struggle continues

Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
