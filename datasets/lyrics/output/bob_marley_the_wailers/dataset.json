    "lyrics": "Dready got a job to do\nAnd he's got to fulfill that mission\nTo see his hurt is their greatest ambition\nBut we will survive in this world of competition\n'cause no matter what they do\nNatty keep on comin' through\nAnd no matter what they say-ay\nDready di deh every day\nNatty Dread rides again\nThrough the mystics of tomorrow\nNatty Dread rides again\nHave no fear, have no sorrow\n\nAll and all you see a-gwan\nIs to fight against the Rastaman\nSo they build their world on great confusion\nTo force on us the devil's illusion\nBut the stone that the builder refuse\nShall be the head cornerstone\nAnd no matter what game they play\nWe've got something they could never take away\nWe've got something they could never take away\n\nAnd it's the fire, it's the fire\nThat's burning down everything\nFeel the fire, fire\nOnly the birds have their wings\nNo time to be deceived\nOh, brothers, you should know and not believe\nJah say this judgement - it could never be with water\nNo water can put out this fire\nThis fire, this fire, this fire\nA yaga y'all! Ride, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there\nBecause now the fire is out of control\nPanic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold\nEverywhere this fire is burning\nDestroying and melting their gold\nDestroying and wasting their souls\n\nRide, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there\n\nTell you what: now the people gather on the beach\nAnd the leader try to make a speech\nBut the Dreadies understanding that it's too late\nFire is burning\nMan, pull your own weight\nFire is burning\nMan, pull your own weight\nNatty Dread rides again\nAnd me saying Go there, Dready\nOh ride, Natty, ride\nAnd go there, Dready\nRiding through the storm\nRiding through the calm\n\nOh ride, Natty, ride\nGo there, Dready, go there"
