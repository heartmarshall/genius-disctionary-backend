Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now

Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now

Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?"

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore (One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know, if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (Drive)

""If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'""

It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say, ""I miss you so much""
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love

Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Watching

Wondering what went wrong

Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
God's a charlatan, don't look back, babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?

Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

With his ultraviolence

Give me all of that ultraviolence

We could go back to Woodstock

Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

I love you the first time
I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa
Comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer
And you're my cult leader
I love you forever
I love you forever

No, I'm not, that, I'm not

Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""

Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not

And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times

I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is

When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head

I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art

Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun

I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
""I believe in the kindness of strangers""

And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride

Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?

I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free"

Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hangin' from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're goin' in

So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, makin' me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact (Kiss, kiss)

I sing the national anthem
While I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealin' with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(
""Yes, of course I will, my darling""
)

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how? Now take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

I told you that, no matter what you did, I'd be by your side

Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind

Thinking, ""I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two""

Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I
Ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die

Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry

Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me

Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me"

I hoped that you'd come back again and tell me everything's okay
Ayy, babe, yeah

Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I wanna leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everythin', then took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again to tell me everything's okay
Babe, babe, yeah

(It's fuckin' hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this Sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho-ho-ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby (Baby), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Takin' all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm gettin' on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day to tell you that I really changed
Baby

(It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho-ho-ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it"

Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

And you're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said, you're a wild mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'"
