Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse
All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day, locked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, ""How'd I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions
You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think ""How did I get here, sitting next to you?""
But after all I've said, please don't forget
(Watch it)
(Watch it)

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (In the city, boy, in the city)
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know (Watch it)
Please, all my friends are heathens, take it slow (Watch it)
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)
I tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)
And now they're outside, ready to bust (And guess what?)
It looks like you might be one of us"

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our mama sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names

I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind

On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But it don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions, they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'

My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire, exhale desire
I know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve, my skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And-a from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one, please, because
Faith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts so often, I ought
To replace that slot with what I once bought
'Cause somebody stole my car radio

For now, I see that ""if"" and ""when"" are truly different cries
For ""if"" is purely panic and ""when"" is solemn sorrow
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded
There's no above or under or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else, I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else

He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki
He's got no friends close but those who know him most know
He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
When I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me

I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else, I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me
Ones and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes
Count to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded
There's no above, or under, or around it
For ""above"" is blind belief and ""under"" is sword to sleeve
And ""around"" is scientific miracle, let's pick ""above"" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
And that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time
I'll morph to someone else, I'm just a ghost

If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow
I'll morph to someone else, I'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
If I keep moving, they won't know
I'll morph to someone else
A defense mechanism mode
I'll morph to someone else

Not done, not done
Not done, Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else"

What's my problem?
Well, I want you to follow me down to the bottom
Underneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em
'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem?
We glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win
And right before we turn on them
We give 'em the highest of praise
And hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving
An earlier grave is an optional way, no

What's my problem?
Don't get it twisted
It's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations
I could give up, and boost up my reputation
I could go out with a bang
They would know my name
They would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient
My opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talkin' action
We don't get enough love? Well, they get a fraction
They say, ""How could he go if he's got everything?”
I'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king

Neon gravestones try to call (Neon gravestones try to call)
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones (Neon gravestones try to call)
Call (For my bones)
Call, call, call

Promise me this (Call, call)
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move on to someone else
Promise me this
If I lose to myself
You won't mourn a day
And you'll move on to someone else

'Cause they won't get 'em
No, they won't get 'em
They won't get 'em
But they won't get 'em

Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness
Is beating a stigma that no longer scares us
But for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness
Could we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted
To use this mistake as a form of aggression?
A form of succession? A form of a weapon?
Thinking ""I'll teach them,"" well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds
I'm not disrespecting what was left behind
Just pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age
Pay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated
Now, that should be celebrated"

Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things on the brink of blasphemy
I'm my own shrink
Think things are after me, I'm my catastrophe
At my kitchen sink
You don't know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me
Okay, friend?
Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah, it might be worthless
Then paint something, and it might be wordless
Pointless curses, nonsense verses
You'll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them could be the beginning
Of your meaning, friend

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone

Nobody thinks what you think, no one
Empathy might be on the brink of extinction
They will play a game
And say they know what you're going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way to say
They don't know you
And neither do I
So here's a prime example of a stand-up guy who
Hates what he believes and loves it at the same time
Here's my brother
And his head's screwed up, but that's all right

Time gains momentum the moment when I'm living in 'em
I'm winning a momentary, sinning a moment passing after
A re-beginning moment's mending memories
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have been a better man
Copy and paste caught me, and copy, better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm, the badder I am
But I bet I'll battle with 'em battle
Better I am, gamblin' man, better bet I am a gambling man, I am?

Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone

Leave me alone!
Don't leave me alone!

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone

I-I-I-I-I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive, you gotta kill your mind

Don't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, sever all
I thought I could depend on my weekends
On the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges
Better test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Keep your wooden wedges under doors
Chorus, verse, chorus, verse, now here comes the eight
Wait, habits here too, you're the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
At least they all know all they hear comes from a place

Who takes every moment he knows he confided in

Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote your show's next episode

To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old man's hair receding
I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!"" on my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this, is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one, be the one who has the
Sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone

But I'll tell 'em, ""Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant""
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I'll tell 'em

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!""
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling

But the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this

Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench

I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)

Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting
Gobsmacked, don't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
In the same night, and won't hesitate
To maybe overcompensate

I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy, prodigal son
Done running, come up with Josh Dun, wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve, you bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb for passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self

I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Mm, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
The days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer, but for goodness' sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón

Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react, acting

Simply suggest my chest and this confused music

Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth
Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I try my best and all that I can to
Hold tightly onto what's left in my hand
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
I'm just bein' dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth, bindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again, see You tomorrow, but it's the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case
But You specialize in dyin', You hear me screamin', ""Father!""

Driving once again, but now this time, there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day""
And then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more, pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searchin' for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, ""Am I alive and well
Or am I dreaming dead?""
Then one turned around to say
""We're driving toward the morning, son
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone""

I said, ""Don't be afraid""

Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing
Plummet as I sing

All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly, we're probably
More suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart
And the light will set us free

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I

How frustrating and so degrading
His time, we're wasting as time will fly by
And the sky will cry as light is fading
And He is waiting, oh, so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
And please think about why you can't sleep, uh, in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
And I promise you, this is mine

He collected many things but never quite enough
Tried lookin' at it from a new perspective
Flat on his back but he still heard the directive
Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived
Never asked permission, he just hopes that they forgive

She's not afraid of her reflection
But of what she might see behind it
She had plans to change her name (Yeah)
Just not the traditional way (Yeah)
Haunted by a couple big mistakes
She covers all the dents with the way she decorates
Then one night, she got cold with no blankets on her bed
So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said

With the bells and the whistles scaled back
Like an isolated track
And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated
Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week
He might have made it if he lived on a different street
I repeat, scaled back and isolated
He says he likes an open schedule, but he mostly hates it
If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break in
Put your ear up to the door, tell me, can you hear him saying?

That your dad is now the Pantaloon

And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind

Between the Sun and the Moon
In the morning air, how

Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny

Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmares and your frights

You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
So lose your mind
You are tired, you are hurt
A moth ate through your favorite shirt
And all your friends, they fertilize the ground you walk
Lose your mind"
