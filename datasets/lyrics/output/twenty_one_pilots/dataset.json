You knew you should have stayed (It's blasphemy)\nI tried to warn you just to stay away (Wouldn't listen to me)\nAnd now they're outside, ready to bust (And guess what?)\nIt looks like you might be one of us"

A form of a weapon?\nThinking \"I'll teach them,\" well, I'm refusing the lesson\nIt won't resonate in our minds\nI'm not disrespecting what was left behind\nJust pleading that it does not get glorified\nMaybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high\nFind your grandparents or someone of age\nPay some respects for the path that they paved\nTo life, they were dedicated\nNow, that should be celebrated"
